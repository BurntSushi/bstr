My Sassy Girl
Exactly two years ago today, she and I buried a time capsule here.
We promised to meet here two years later, but she hasn't come yet.
I'm going to wait.
Here we go.
Please, don't move.
One, two...
Wait a minute.
Hello?
Oh, auntie.
Sorry, I'm on my way.
I'm really sorry.
Yes, I'm coming.
I'm having my photo taken.
Bye.
Are you ready?
Here we go.
One, two...
My parents wanted a daughter, so they raised me like one.
So I thought I was a girl until I was seven.
I had to go to the women's public bath, too.
The older I got,
I thought my penis would get smaller and disappear.
But it was the opposite.
First Half
He hasn't changed at all.
No, I'm a real man now.
Hey, asshole.
Think clerical work in the army makes you a man?
You irritate me!
Give me a break, asshole.
My job was tougher than you could imagine.
Hey!
I worked near the DMZ.
Who are you kidding?
Hold it.
Anyway, welcome back home.
She's just my type.
When I see my type, I can't help it.
I need to hit on her.
Who's interrupting me?
Hello?
Who is this?
- Your mother, you bastard.
- Oh, mom...
Why aren't you at your aunt's house?
I'm leaving soon.
Keep quiet!
It's my mom!
Talk over there!
Make sure you pay a visit.
It's been over a year since you saw her.
That long?
You know she feels lonely after losing her son last year.
She says you resemble him.
She'll be so glad to see you.
Still there?
We don't look alike.
Plus, I hate when she rubs my face and kisses me.
Uncle does, too.
She'll introduce you to a girl.
Hey!
I know the type she likes.
Tell her no thanks.
I want to meet a girl like the ones in romantic comic books.
But on that day...
She's my type, but I don't like her.
Why?
Drunk girls disgust me.
Hey, get up!
Offer your seat to the elderly!
Ugh!
Go!
Hey.
Don't wear pink.
Honey!
She call him honey!
I'm not...
What are you doing!
I'm not...
You handle this!
I'm not...
Think I'm stupid?
Come here!
Are you laughing?
Why didn't you look after her?
Hurry and do something!
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Let me help with cleaning expenses.
Forget it.
Just take care of her.
Nothing's there when you need it.
Where did all those motels go?
I hate being with a drunk girl.
Carrying her on my back is worse.
Wow, your honey's wasted.
No, it's not my fault.
Of course, it is.
I know everything.
You see, we're engaged.
Western or Korean style?
Give me any room.
Room 405.
None on the first floor?
Fourth floor!
You forgot to check in.
It's 40,000 won, kid.
What?
40,000 won?
Why?
Find another place then.
Count it.
624... 770...
Shindang-dong, Joong-gu...
Seoul...
Hey, why do you keep reading this?
016... 228... 53...
Oh, please...
A thousand won left!
Hello?
This phone's owner?
She's sleeping beside me.
What?
Here?
The Uk-su motel near Bupyung station.
Better wash and leave fast.
Aha!
Hands in the air!
What are you doing?
Hands in the air!
Aaggh!
No, I'm not, sir!
I told you.
I'm an innocent victim.
Talk about it later and get in there.
Oh, damn!
I'm gonna die mad!
Come over here.
Come on!
Please, forgive me just this once.
Please, forgive me.
I can't get in there...
How are you?
Please, please, save my life!
Hi?
How are you?
Please, just for once!
Please...
See you!
What's your name?
Answer now!
Boss told you!
Gyeon-woo, I'm Gyeon-woo.
What brought you here?
I'm innocent.
I'm telling the truth, sir!
So you're an innocent and we're fucking guilty, huh?
No, I don't mean that!
That's exactly what you said, motherfucker!
I'm gonna put it right.
I'm sorry.
You raped a girl, huh?
Nope!
No!
Come on!
Shoot now, you little creep!
You wanna cut your finger or talk now?
Huh?
Be quick, he told you... you little bastard!
You turn against him, or what?
All of you.
Eat one a piece, okay?
Yes, boss.
What are you looking at?
Look away.
Gyeon-woo!
You're out!
Take care you guys!
Bye!
And remember to keep in touch!
Uh...
Oh, yeah.
Don't just pass by us next time, all right?
Of course.
See you.
Hey!
You come over here.
Didn't I say eat one a piece!
I'm home.
Did you go to Bupyung?
Yes, I did.
Come here!
Where did you sleep?
Your aunt said you didn't come!
And you're telling me a lie!
What happened to your sweater?
I'm such a poor guy.
All this because of a drunk girl.
I wanna die.
You asked if I went to Bupyung!
I did, but not to see auntie!
What?
Bastard!
Wait till he comes back.
Know me now, right?
I'm a typical student.
An engineering major.
Study?
I'm smart, but I never study.
My parents can prove that.
You're smart like me, but studying is your problem.
Since you inherited your brain from me, you'll get good grades if you study harder, idiot.
Up four points in three years.
Call this a report card?
Since you inherited your brain from your mom, you'll get good grades if you study harder.
If you raise kids, never tell them they're smart.
They'll never study.
My goals?
Haven't thought about it yet.
You know now?
You got it.
I'm a hopeless student.
Hello?
Who are you, asshole?
What?
Who's calling?
Why were you naked in a motel with me?
What?
Come out!
To Bupyung station now!
Uh...
How could she do this?
I went to jail and got beaten with a vacuum for her.
Excuse me.
Is it you?
Yes?
Follow me.
Get over here.
What do you wanna eat?
Cherry Jubilee...
Mango Tango or Shooting Stars...
Jamonka Almond's good, too.
I'll just have a Love Me.
Hey, wanna die?
Drink coffee.
Two coffees.
You pay for it.
Tell me.
What happened last night?
Well, it's...
You were drunk, so...
Don't stumble, and speak clearly!
You see.
You were drunk and staggering at the subway station.
I saved you from the train.
I thought maybe this girl was a snake.
Pretending to be drunk and vomiting to use the guy in a state of confusion.
So I called you honey?
That's right.
I kind of remember that.
You showered to wash off vomit and sweat, and the police came?
That's right.
Would you believe that, too?
To a girl like this, you need to show her who's the boss.
So I did that, right?
Yes, you did.
- Sorry, it's late.
- Yeah...
When she's not drunk, she's just my type.
You look prettier and livelier than yesterday.
Are you mocking me?
No, I'm not.
Then are you hitting on me?
I don't wanna date you.
We're not destined for each other.
Throw the trash away.
Damn it.
I think she's a heavy drinker.
You order.
Kimchi soup and Soju, please.
Eat Golbangee.
Then you should order.
Stop pouting!
Golbangee, please.
Let's go somewhere fun later.
I know what that means.
- A motel?
Are you rich?
- Of course.
How much will you give us?
We'll see, so don't worry.
You kids are prostituting, huh?
Why'd you order Golbangee?
Eat something else!
What's it to you?
Mind your own business.
We're just having a drink with some friends.
What's wrong?
You take friends to a motel?
How old are you kids?
Old enough to drink.
Mind your own business.
Think I'm doing this 'cause you're drinking?
Show me your ID.
You, too.
What's with you?
Show it, now.
This sucks.
She's a vicious chick.
No matter how pretty she is,
I'm too embarrassed to be with her.
Who are you to butt in other people's business?
- Don't you have a daughter?
- I don't.
Bear me one.
Who the hell do you think you are?
- How dare you?
- Come on, let's fight!
Come on!
I'll show you.
Don't live like that!
Catch up with the girls.
Have a drink and calm down.
Shit!
Ah!
Seeing a girl cry makes me sad for some reason.
She's more attractive the closer I look at her.
Did you blow your nose on this?
No.
Please, stop crying.
Also...
The handkerchief is mine.
To be honest,
I broke up with my boyfriend yesterday.
Excuse me.
Wake up.
Come on, wake up.
Your fiances wasted again?
What now?
Sign you in like before, right?
Yes.
But, mister, have any medicine for alcohol?
No, you buy it.
Where did you go, honey?
- What!
What is it?
- Uh!
I saw her lips.
Her white neck.
And...
I saw her breast, too.
While watching her sleep like a baby, it may be forward, but this occurred to me.
I want to heal her sorrow.
Give me some water.
Hey.
Why am I here?
You see.
I'm sorry, but I saw your ID, and you're twenty-four.
If you talk down on me again...
So what are you gonna do?
Just that...
Nothing.
Give me the towel.
Yes.
You see, I'm a year older.
- Then talk like friends.
- Yeah?
Toothbrush.
Toothpaste?
In the bathroom.
Our relationship is so peculiar.
We met only three days ago, and slept twice in a motel.
That's how our relationship began.
Lee Hyung-chul.
Here.
Jeun Mi-young.
Here.
Kang Man-gyu.
Yep.
Gyeon-woo.
Is he absent?
No, no!
I'm here!
Then answer right away.
Phew!
Gonna be sucks!
Lee Jeung-min.
Here.
Gu Seol-soo.
Yes, I'm here.
Professor.
How about a break?
You're right.
Let's take a break.
Let's go.
Go where?
Class isn't over yet.
Don't be a coward.
He called roll, right?
Let's go.
I can't.
I can't miss this class.
Kill me instead.
All right.
Who is she?
She's pretty.
Pretty?
Doesn't matter.
A girl needs to act pretty.
- But she's still pretty.
- Nice body, too.
Who's Gyeon-woo?
It's me, sir.
I won't mark you absent so you can leave.
Pardon me?
I said leave.
Why?
Wasn't that girl your girlfriend?
So go see her.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, Gyeon-woo.
If you can, raise it with her.
It worked.
What did you tell him?
That I'm getting an abortion, and you're the father.
What?
No, no!
Professor, it's not true!
She wanted to be a scriptwriter, so she kept writing stories.
She called them synopsis.
To get me into the mood, she took me to the park to read them.
Reading her synopsis was stressful.
If I miss anything, I'm dead.
Wanna die?
Finish reading it.
I will.
Mister!
How could you throw the butt here?
Pick it up!
And why did you wear that color?
Then what about you?
Don't wear the same color as mine!
The heroine is tough, like the "Terminator".
The year is 2137.
Villains kidnap her lover and travels to the present.
I don't know why.
To save her lover, she travels in a time machine to the present.
They have to kiss in the end.
This isn't a melodrama.
It's an action movie.
You don't know movies.
Koreans like melodramas.
Why?
Know what novel touched us when we were teenagers?
"Shower" by Hwang Sun-won.
It shaped our people's sensibility in their teens.
Koreans like sad movies all because of "Shower".
"Shower"?
What's sad about it?
It's sad when she asked to be buried in the clothes reminiscent of her love.
I couldn't sleep for one week.
The ending sucks.
Gotta change it.
How?
It's sad.
Her family couldn't afford to pay for her medicine.
Their family line is broken up now.
But, you know, she must have been an extraordinary girl.
Why?
This was her last request.
When I die, please, bury me with my loving friend.
What?
To bury him alive, even.
Oh, my gosh.
- What's the matter?
- What's wrong?
No way!
This is wrong!
This is wrong!
This is wrong!
Please.
Don't!
Bury him!
They bury him alive.
Isn't it sad?
I must be hurt still.
I think I'll never get over him.
How deep could it be?
I don't know.
Gyeon-woo, go in the water.
I wanna know how deep it is.
Come on.
Help me!
Help me!
Wow, it's deep.
I can't swim!
Yes, it's deep...
My mind was getting blurry.
At that moment...
Heard you got a girlfriend.
Introduce me.
- Really?
- I'm serious.
Is she pretty?
Have you kissed her?
Girlfriend?
Gonna introduce me or not?
She's really pretty?
What are you looking at?
See that girl over there?
She's my girlfriend from today.
Got it?
Hey...
Excuse me...
Hey, baby.
- Are you free?
- Hey?
What?
Baby?
Hey!
Come here.
Hmm!
How could a coincidence like this happen?
Reportedly there is a runaway soldier...
Hello?
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
Let's drink.
Drink till we die.
One hour ago It's me.
Where are you?
What are you doing?
Meeting your friends?
Can't I join us, can I?
Why not?
I wanna see your friends!
Hey!
Hey!
Now, you're dead.
Excuse me...
You've just forgotten your things.
Oh, my gosh!
It's kind of you, thanks.
Do you want me to hold it for you?
- Oh, no.
That's all right.
- All right then.
I'll help you, ma'am.
- Oh, thank you.
- No problem.
Watch your step!
Hey, money!
Ooh!
Damn it!
Since I'm drunk,
I decided to take revenge on her.
If I'm out cold at Bupyung station, then she'll have to carry me on her back.
This stop is Bupyung station...
Hey, kid.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Where am I?
I'm at Inchon station.
Be here in 30 minutes.
Wake up.
Get up, idiot.
Go away, buttbrain.
Talking back?
- Get up, bastard!
- What the...
How're you?
Hi!
How are you?
Oh, how is it going?
What?
Go away, buttbrain?
You got a bad mouth.
I'll set you straight the gangster's way.
On your head.
Get up.
Sit down.
Get up.
Sit down.
Roll right.
Roll left.
Do it right.
Keep going!
What's going on there?
Stop fooling around.
Hey!
You low-life thieves.
- What officer?
- Keep quiet.
Low-life thieves?
Damn it.
- Hey.
Want some of this?
- No, thanks.
Try it.
It's delicious.
- No.
- Hey, boy.
Pay attention to your elders.
Eat it, buttbrain.
I told you no.
How many times did I tell you?
Am I your toy?
Leave me alone you petty thieves!
Stop toying with me, you jerks!
It's humiliating!
Oh, shit!
Good morning.
- Keep quiet!
- Thank you.
Thank you.
You bastard!
Do that again, and you're dead.
What?
Are you free, baby?
Your English is good, too.
Better behave!
Wanna die?
Taste good?
It's so delicious.
You're very happy to see me, aren't you?
Be good to me... and you'll always be with good luck.
If I sleep out, mom beats me with whatever's in her hand.
If she's sweeping, it's a broom stick
If she's cleaning, it's a vacuum.
When I'm lucky, it's a cucumber or eggplant.
So I have to come at the right time.
You studying now?
Yes, I'm.
I'm looking over something on the Internet.
- Go to bed now.
- You too, dad.
- All right, good night!
- Good night.
Ok then, I'm gonna have a sleep too.
You're not looking at dirty pictures, right?
Of course not, dad.
You don't trust me?
No, I do.
Time for bed.
- Go to sleep.
- Good night, dad.
Uh?
Hi, Gyeon-woo.
My birthday's in two days.
You're dead if you forget.
Got it?
Since I like you so much, better make me smile like this.
*^____________.^*
Got it?
I got it.
Phew!
Her birthday.
If I prepare nothing, she may murder me.
I have a good idea.
Before going to the service, I worked in a theme park.
So this is my plan.
At midnight, I'll be alone with her in the park.
It'll be completely dark all around us.
One by one, the lights to the merry-go-round flick on.
I raise my arms up there, and her birthday song starts.
Then all the lights turn on and it moves.
There's fireworks, too.
Isn't it fantastic?
She'll be thrilled.
I gave 200,000 won to my friends working there.
- Jump over here?
- Yeah.
We have to.
I always wanted to come here at night.
It's my birthday, not yours.
Please, let's just try.
I'll go up first and help you.
Eh?
There's a step here.
Take my hand.
Oh, shit!
Shit!
Gyeon-woo.
Hey!
Answer me.
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
Answer me!
Gyeon-woo!
You're dead.
Wait till I catch you.
Why didn't you answer?
Wanna die?
Come with me!
Hurry and get in.
Shut up!
Go in fast.
Move it.
Sit here.
If you're loud, I'll kill you.
Got it?
Yes.
- Answer quietly!
- Yes.
Is that a real gun?
- Wanna see?
- Forget it.
How are you two related?
We're just friends.
Really?
You mean she could be my pussy?
What?
Your pussy?
I'm not a cat or anything!
Go ahead and apologize!
Alright.
I'll do it.
I'm sorry.
Anyway, friends come here late at night?
Why are you here?
We just wanted to come here at night.
- Tell me the truth, idiot.
- Nothing special.
Bullshit.
What makes you trust a guy like him?
I trusted myself.
I had a girlfriend, too.
She visited me every week for one year.
I was so happy.
But that bitch fell in love with the guard house sergeant.
I found out the fact after he was discharged.
Damn it.
While I'm in the service, even my dog... ran away with some mutt, too.
My Yorkshire terrier.
Bitch.
Fuck.
I came out to kill both bitches.
Fuck.
I have the worst luck in this world.
Damn it.
Know what special day is it today?
Huh, damn it?
This sucks!
Hey, what are the odds to meet a runaway soldier in a park?
Don't know.
Heard your head blows up if you shoot in the mouth.
Yeah, the hole in your head is this big.
That's serious.
A teeny bullet does that?
Yeah, the bullet tears the...
Hey!
What are you two doing?
Stop joking around.
Damn it.
Damn it!
Even you bastards ignore me.
- That's why you shouldn't be foolish.
- Why?
Am I foolish?
Even if you do this, she won't come back.
I know.
I know, too.
But if I die, she'll be heartbroken.
She'll never be the same.
You're wrong.
The pain goes away sooner than you think.
You went through something like this?
Yeah.
It happens that way.
Damn it.
If I'm caught, I'll go to the can.
I'll always think of her there.
What does "can" mean?
It means prison.
- Don't interrupt.
- Sorry.
Anyway, you're responsible for your actions now.
Excuse me, sir.
How about letting her go?
If I say no?
Then let me go, instead.
Come to think of it, your eyebrows remind me of that sergeant.
You act like him, too.
You can go.
And you...
We die together.
Got it?
Pardon?
Hey, lady.
Forget about this bastard, and look for a nice guy.
Got it?
- Go!
- Let's go together.
All three of us.
Will you leave if I kill him?
Gyeon-woo.
Don't worry too much.
This soldier isn't a bad guy.
You'll come out safely.
You're leaving me alone?
There's no other way.
I was afraid to die alone, but I'm glad we're in it together.
Oh, right.
Over there, there's an exit near the merry-go-round.
Nobody knows about it.
I used to work here.
Really?
You're not tricking me, right?
I'm a man, too.
Why would I?
Walk in front of me.
See?
I told you so.
This way!
Shit!
What's going on?
It's Gyeon-woo.
Screw you!
Don't come closer!
I'll kill him!
I'll really kill him!
Tell that bitch to come!
So she can see me die!
I'll give you an hour!
If not, I'll kill him, and myself, too!
- Got it?
- Hurry up!
Sniper 2!
The hostage is in danger, but we can still fire.
Don't!
Wait!
Don't shoot!
Hey, soldier!
I mean... sir!
Your girlfriend changed her mind, right?
Did you really love her?
Ask yourself.
I think you didn't.
If you really love her, you should let her go.
If not, then it's not love.
What's wrong with someone you don't love getting married?
Stop this, and go back to the base as a real man.
A person like you should learn more about love.
If we want to learn, then we should keep living.
Damn it.
She's the nicest girl I've met.
Hey!
Don't let her go.
Got it?
If you do, I'll take her.
- Can I go?
- Go.
Screw it.
Shit!
Don't know.
Thank you.
Today's my birthday.
I'll live on until I learn what love is.
What?
We're just friends?
No, I said that to save you.
"Let me go, instead?"
Wanted to save yourself, huh?
He wouldn't have let you go.
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Have a nice life alone.
I screwed up her birthday, but I feel good anyway.
'Cause I'm proud to be with her, and things turned out as planned.
I hope you believe in me.
You can't?
Wait...
Second Half
I remember.
She always came with him until last year.
Was it last spring or winter?
One day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.
To not let anyone sit in his seat that day.
What's up?
Oh, hi.
You're early.
I was in the neighborhood.
Miss me?
Of course!
She always tried hard to look cheery.
- I like her that way.
- What would you like?
Coke, please.
Wanna die?
Drink coffee.
Two coffees, please.
I know her.
She pretends to be happy, but she's full of sorrow inside.
What are you doing?
What are you smiling at?
No.
It's nothing.
Looks fun, huh?
- Another one?
- Why?
Don't wanna read it?
She may get disappointed, but I should be honest for her sake.
Looks fun.
I'll read it.
This time it's a martial arts film.
The heroine is a bounty hunter.
The villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.
The worst of his kind.
What happened?
His name's Gyeon-woo?
Gyeon-woo?
The story's setting is a mess.
Japan invades during King Sejong's reign, and the King's father is the tyrant Yeonsan.
In the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.
Heavy rain pours down on a sunny day.
Yup!
The heroine becomes a King.
King Jung-jo.
She's from the future, of course.
It's fun, huh?
Why is the heroine always from the future?
Science is advanced by then, so they invent a time machine.
And people go to the past to travel.
People from the future could be here now.
I think UFOs are time machines.
Someday, I'll meet someone from the future.
I have to.
If you do, ask him to take you.
What?
If it's possible...
Give this to Shin Cine.
Tell them to cast Han Suk-gyu and Shim Eun-ha.
Jeon Do-yun is okay, too.
Excuse me, we talked on the phone, right?
Well... this is "The Warrior's Sad Love Story"...
It's going to be a hit.
Shin Cine didn't... call back.
Hey!
Hey, kid.
Is the subway your sketch book?
Don't scribble on it.
Wanna die?
My lipstick!
I always take her home, even to Bupyung station.
It's something a man must do.
On the way, we play fun games, too.
Left foot over the line, I win.
With the right foot, you win.
What's the prize?
Let's see...
How about a kiss?
A kiss?
Wanna die?
You choose.
Hitting each other.
Again?
You can hit me, too.
Okay.
Someone's coming.
I think this is unfair.
I'm a girl, so I'll slap the cheek.
No.
Then I'll change it, too.
- But I'm a girl.
- Men and women are equal.
Okay, then.
You slap, and I slap, too.
Go easy on me, and I'll kill you.
Better slap me on the cheek.
If you don't, I'll kill you!
All right.
You slap, and I'll use my finger.
Right, that's fair.
Saw that?
See that guy step over with his left foot?
I had my eyes closed.
Plus he came the opposite way.
I thought it was this way.
Shut up.
Here they come.
Left foot.
Left foot.
It'll be the right foot.
Left!
Left!
Switch to the right.
You have to hit me?
You know why the sky is blue?
'Cause the reflection of the sunshine.
Nope.
It's for me!
I want it to be blue.
So, it's blue.
You know why the fire is hot?
It's all for me.
I want it to be hot.
So it is.
You know why we have four seasons here in Korea?
- Because of you.
- That's correct!
And why you were born here?
- It's for me as well.
- What?
That's nonsense.
I was born before you.
You know the word "worship"?
"Peter came first in order to prepare for the birth of Jesus," huh?
Well...
Yeah, I know.
So, get ready!
Come here.
Stay still.
When I'm with her,
I never know how the day will turn out.
What?
What are you looking at?
I quit!
Is your face a racket?
Why does the ball always hit my face?
It's strange.
I never want to lose a game.
So I play until I win.
Wait long?
Just a teeny bit.
My mom bought me these heels, but they're killing my feet.
Want a massage?
No, it's okay.
Instead, let's exchange shoes.
Don't wanna?
How can a guy wear heels?
It'll fit.
But, I can't...
Yeah?
I see.
Come on.
I'll buy you some sneakers.
Forget it.
Then wear mine, and I'll carry yours.
You don't understand women.
Okay!
Let's exchange.
Really?
Wanna know a secret?
What is it?
I don't wear panties on exam day.
But I had one today.
Catch me, honey!
Hey.
If you don't, I'll kill you.
- Phew...
- Catch me, honey...!
Stop right there!
Stop!
Out!
It was just a second, but I felt something in her eyes.
That's my house.
Wait.
I'll bring you an umbrella.
I'm okay.
I'm already wet so I'll just leave.
Eh?
Gee...
Are you my daughter's boyfriend?
Yes, sir.
How much do you know about my daughter?
Not much...
Next time, don't hang out till late.
You don't understand me.
Why'd you stand him up?
What's wrong with him?
Why do you stand guys up?
And what happened to your heels?
What's wrong with you?
I told you not to meet Gyeon-woo.
He's dumb and has no future.
It's none of your business.
Why is he stupid?
You're stupid so you don't know.
What has gotten into you?
Let me live my own life!
Afterwards,
I didn't hear from her for a long time.
- Hello?
- Gyeon-woo, it's me.
Long time no see.
Her voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.
Our 100th day celebration is soon.
It's 100 days already?
When do you think a girl's the prettiest?
When a sexy woman is naked.
Where are you now?
Stay right there.
No, I'm just kidding.
The prettiest is when she's playing the piano.
What's your favorite song?
That George Winston song.
Pachelbel Canon?
Yeah, that song.
You're not gonna ask me?
When is the guy the prettiest?
Just give me a rose.
Still have your high school uniform?
Yeah.
Why?
Bring it on our 100th day, and give me a rose during my class.
Do it yourself, okay?
What?
What did you say?
How can I during class?
Hey!
Just hung up on me!
Damn it!
I don't wanna get beaten by her, or get humiliated at a women's college.
Oh, my God!
A burglar!
Help, a burglar!
Eh?
Are you crazy?
You're gonna break into where?
What on Earth are you doing in broad daylight?
And you...
Why you didn't drop by your aunt's, coming and going to Bupyung for the girl?
You never know how much hard time I went through for you.
She even intends to introduce a girl to you.
Gyeon-woo!
Where are you going?
I'm cleverer than I look.
These girls sure love Chinese food.
Hey, you!
Where you headed?
Come here!
I'm delivering Chinese food.
I ordered it.
Bring it here.
Really?
Bring a lot of radish?
Oh, I forgot something!
Give me the food first!
That's the wrong way!
There's another customer.
Hey!
But that wasn't enough for her.
We relived our old high school days.
Drink!
Drink till die!
I've never had anything like this.
Gee!
Sorry, I'm gonna drink it in my way.
Feeling so good!
Have a smoke, too!
Wow, I've never had a smoke, either!
Gonna be a big deal.
I don't smoke well...
What are we supposed to do if caught by teacher?
It's a suspension!
You've already had your ups and downs in life.
Not to worry.
Go ahead and smoke!
Hey, you are such a tough cookie!
You go to a very good school!
These clothes are so tight!
After we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.
But she got wasted again.
Oh, wild teens!
Here's a condom.
Let's prevent AIDS.
Taxi!
She's having a happy dream.
Compared to when I looked at her in the motel the first time, she looks so different.
Could her pain be cured now?
Maybe it means that she doesn't need me anymore.
Excuse me.
Can you drive slowly?
Here.
Have any plans after graduation?
Actually, I've never thought about it yet.
Can I see what's in your pocket?
Sir?
Right.
It's a condom.
What is this for?
Oh, right.
I learned that it prevents AIDS.
But I haven't used it yet.
- Actually, on the way here.
- Forget it.
"Chicks Hen"?
What does this mean?
Oh, right.
It's a chicken soup restaurant.
"We'll satisfy all your wishes?"
I think it's to satisfy our tastes.
"Hurry and tell him."
How do feel about our daughter?
Oh, right.
We're just friends now.
Please, don't worry.
If we get closer, I'll let you know, sir.
Don't see her any more.
After that day, she never calls me.
It was sudden, but that's how we broke up.
We've broken up.
Now, I'm free.
It's me.
Come to the cafe by seven o'clock.
Why?
What?
I have a blind date today.
Come in 45 minutes.
I have a blind date, too.
Are you on your way?
I'm on a date with a girl.
Hurry up.
I have to go to the bathroom.
"Gotta go to the bathroom."
Eh?
Nice to meet you.
I'm Cha Seok-won.
Nice to meet you.
- Same here.
- Have a seat.
Were you really with a girl?
No, I was with a guy.
Can I take your order?
Coffee, please.
You can drink coke.
I'll drink coffee.
Gyeon-woo.
You're very lucky.
I heard a lot about you.
That you're a close friend.
Friend...
I need to go to the bathroom.
How is he?
No idea... but he looks nice.
He is not the man you broke up with, is he?
How do you know?
When you see a new man...
Forget about the past, all right?
How the hell do you know?
This necklace was given to you from your ex-boyfriend, isn't it?
You wouldn't wear it, if you just broke up for nothing.
Considering your temper... and you... used to say that you couldn't get over him.
Does that mean he isn't here anymore in this world.
That man is the one my mom introduced to me.
She kept pushing me to meet him...
Doesn't look bad, does he?
Yes.
Hey, listen!
I'm totally okay, but you should be obedient to a man.
A man likes something more feminine.
And... don't drink a lot.
Some of the guys target intoxicated girls.
And it's all right with me, but to the other guys... try to surrender just for once don't try to win.
Good luck to you.
Where's Gyeon-woo?
He left already.
He told me ten rules to follow.
I have a good memory.
I'll recite them.
First, don't ask her to be feminine.
And don't...
Second, don't let her drink over three glasses.
She'll beat someone.
At a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.
If she hits you, act like it hurts.
If it hurts, act like it doesn't.
On your 100th day together, give her a rose during her class.
She'll like it a lot.
Make sure you learn fencing and squash.
Also, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.
If she says she'll kill you... don't take it lightly.
You'll feel better.
If her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.
Finally, she likes to write.
Encourage her.
Ladies and gentlemen, please, pay attention...
Gyeon-woo.
Step back behind the yellow line...
Gyeon-woo!
after passengers getting off, take in order...
Gyeon-woo!
...please, use the next train.
What's his name?
Gyeon-woo.
I'll do it myself.
Gyeon-woo.
Where are you?
I looked all over for you.
Gyeon-woo!
Come to the escalator.
Okay?
You're dead if you don't.
Hurry up.
Who told you to hug me?
Dummy.
You're supposed to dodge.
Sometimes I feel like I know her and sometimes I don't.
We're definitely standing at the crossroad now.
What's going on between us?
Can this relationship last forever?
Who is it?
It's me, dad.
She told me to write a letter and bring it.
To write it on paper.
To express my feelings,
I tried hard to find the right words.
When I first met her,
I wanted to cure her grief, but now I can't give her up.
I wish we can get serious.
I'm writing about these feelings.
She's probably writing about me now.
This is how we're preparing to split up.
Gyeon-woo.
See that mountain top?
Yeah.
Could someone hear me from there?
Yes, probably so.
Or probably not.
Then go over there.
I'll shout here.
If you hear, answer me.
You want me to go over there?
Yeah.
Gyeon-woo?
Can you hear me?
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry.
I really can't help it.
Gyeon-woo.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry...
I can't help it.
I thought I was different, but I'm just a helpless girl.
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry.
Did you bring your letter?
Yeah.
What's that?
A time capsule.
We put our letters in it and bury it here.
And two years later, let's meet here again.
We'll read the letters that day, and maybe we can find an answer then.
This was her way of saying good-bye, and I kept repeating in my mind that two years isn't long.
Let's open this exactly two years later, at two.
Okay?
We can meet two years later.
When we meet then, we'll be different from what we are now.
We may become closer, or stay forever apart.
We can only choose one.
Gyeon-woo.
You go first.
Let's separate here.
Should we go together?
No, I'll take the next train.
I think that's better.
See you two years later!
Okay, in two years!
Two years!
Bye!
Gyeon-woo!
That's how we broke up.
Overtime
I couldn't endure the loneliness after we broke up.
Thinking of those memories,
I started to write about our stories on the Internet.
Then I made up my mind.
If I meet her again, I'll show her a different me.
Got to make use of my time.
For her and my future's sake.
Why does the ball I hit keep hitting my face?
I wrote our stories on the Internet everyday, and I kept myself busy for two years.
Yup!
Excuse me.
I wrote "My Sassy Girl".
Shin Cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.
I made her dream come true instead.
I wanted to tell her right away, but I can only wait till that day.
She didn't come.
It's our only day to meet.
No one knows when she will come.
Wow!
How did he get in here?
It's a mystery.
Gyeon-woo!
How are you?
I was so happy while being with you.
I'm not sure if you knew, but the person I loved passed away.
The day when I first met you was the day he died a year before.
Actually, I tried to look for him in you.
I know it was wrong.
I'm sorry.
I also met him on the subway like you.
I was really sick at that time.
He did everything I wanted.
Like you did to me.
Under this tree, we planned our future together.
But he suddenly passed away.
While I was dating you, I met his mother often.
She wanted to introduce a nice man to me, but I couldn't.
The day I first met you, I came under this tree, and I prayed to him.
To let me free.
When I met you, this occurred to me.
That maybe... he introduced you to me.
But the more I met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.
The more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.
While the two of us are apart,
I want to forget him alone.
After that day, I went often to this place.
If I'm not with you after two years, it means I still lack of courage.
How much will we change after two years?
I feel like you live in the future, and I stay in the past.
I want to meet you soon, so I can read your letter.
Why are you staring at me, sir?
Because you're so pretty.
I thought an angel came down.
Do you come here often?
Sometimes.
This tree has a secret.
I have a secret here, too.
Really?
Three years ago, I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.
What's your secret?
So what happened?
We promised to read the letters a year ago.
But I couldn't come.
I guess you're a year late.
But two years didn't seem that long.
I haven't made any decision yet.
I just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.
Like what?
If we were destined to meet,
I thought we'd meet by chance somewhere.
Know what fate is?
Building a bridge of chance for someone you love.
To be honest, I read you guys letters.
I said this tree had a secret, right?
Yes.
Look closely.
Does this tree look the same as before?
Well, it looks like it changed a bit.
But I'm not sure.
People are dead or alive.
There's a dead tree and a living tree, too.
This tree was struck dead by lightning last year.
It was split into two.
But this young man felt sorry for it.
During this Spring, he planted another tree that looked the same.
When he planted the tree, he asked me if it looked the same.
He said that someone would be sad if it died, so no one should know.
Gyeon-woo...
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
Hi.
It's been a while.
You've gotten prettier.
You still look young.
How have you been?
You were in England?
Yes.
For one and a half years.
So I can forget him.
I see.
Feel better?
Yes.
A lot better.
Is it true now?
My son might be sad.
He won't.
He'll like it this way.
Good, that's what I really hoped.
Auntie!
I was getting my photo taken.
You naughty boy.
Know how long it's been?
Sorry I didn't tell you before.
This is Gyeon-woo.
Doesn't he resemble him?
When you had a hard time,
I tried to introduce you to him for several years, but he kept getting out of it.
Heard you came to Bupyung often, but you never visited me?
Go out with him.
I thought he'd make things easy for you.
Oh, yeah.
Gyeon-woo, you're going to England, right?
She's already been there, so she can give you some tips.
I don't have to go now.
Why?
You two know each other?
You may not believe it, but I think I met a man from the future.
From your future.
This is how I met her again.
Think it's too coincidental?
It's building a bridge of chance for your love.

(Click)
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) My parents wanted a daughter, so they raised me like one.
So I thought I was a girl until I was seven.
I had to go to the women's public bath, too.
The older I got,
I thought my penis would get smaller and disappear.
But it was the opposite.
First Half
Friend 1 :
He hasn't changed at all.
Gyeon-woo:
No, I'm a real man now.
Friend 2:
Hey, asshole.
Friend 1 :
Think clerical work in the army makes you a man?
Gyeon-woo:
You irritate me!
Gyeon-woo:
Give me a break, asshole.
Gyeon-woo:
My job was tougher than you could imagine.
Gyeon-woo:
Hey!
I worked near the DMZ.
Friend 1 :
Who are you kidding?
Friend 2:
Hold it.
Anyway, welcome back home.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) She's just my type.
When I see my type, I can't help it.
I need to hit on her.
(Cellular phone ringing)
Gyeon-woo:(In anger) Who's interrupting me?
Gyeon-woo:
Hello?
Who is this?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Your mother, you bastard.
/Gyeon-woo:
Oh, mom...
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Why aren't you at your aunt's house?
Gyeon-woo:
I'm leaving soon.
Gyeon-woo:
Keep quiet!
It's my mom!
Friends:
Talk over there!
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Make sure you pay a visit.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
It's been over a year since you saw her.
Gyeon-woo:
That long?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
You know she feels lonely after losing her son last year.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
She says you resemble him.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
She'll be so glad to see you.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Still there?
Gyeon-woo:
We don't look alike.
Gyeon-woo:
Plus, I hate when she rubs my face and kisses me.
Gyeon-woo:
Uncle does, too.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
She'll introduce you to a girl.
Hey!
Gyeon-woo:
I know the type she likes.
Gyeon-woo:
Tell her no thanks.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I want to meet a girl like the ones in romantic comic books.
But on that day... (Train arriving)
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) She's my type, but I don't like her.
Why?
Drunk girls disgust me.
Girl:
Hey, get up!
Girl:
Offer your seat to the elder!
Man:
Ugh!
Girl:
Go!
Girl:
Hey.
Girl:
Don't wear pink.
(Girl feeling like vomiting)
(She swallows at a gulp)
(Gyeon-woo's disgusted at the sight)
(She throws up)
(People around them in commotion)
Girl:
Honey!
People:
She calls him honey!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm not...
Old man:
What are you doing!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm not...
Old man:
You handle this!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm not...
Old man:
Think I'm stupid?
Old man:
Come here!
Old man:
Are you laughing?
Old man:
Why didn't you look after her?
Old man:
Hurry and do something!
Old man:(ln a rage) What are you doing?
Gyeon-woo:
I'm sorry.
Let me help with cleaning expenses.
Old man:
Forget it.
Just take care of her.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Nothing's there when you need it.
Gyeon-woo:
Where did all those motels go?
Gyeon-woo:
I hate being with a drunk girl.
Gyeon-woo:
Carrying her on my back is worse.
Innkeeper:(Sarcastically) Wow, your honey wasted.
Gyeon-woo:
No, it's not my fault.
Innkeeper:
Of course, it is.
I know everything.
Gyeon-woo:
You see, we're engaged.
Innkeeper:
Western or Korean style?
Gyeon-woo:
Give me any room.
Innkeeper:
Room 405.
Gyeon-woo:
None on the first floor?
Innkeeper:
Fourth floor!
(Knock on the door)
Innkeeper:
You forgot to check in.
Innkeeper:
It's 40,000 won, kid.
Gyeon-woo:
What?
40,000 won?
Innkeeper:
Why?
Find another place then.
Gyeon-woo:
Count it.
Innkeeper:624... 770
Innkeeper:
Shindang-dong, Joong-gu...
Seoul...
Gyeon-woo:
Hey, why do you keep reading this?
Innkeeper:016... 228... 53...
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, please...
Innkeeper:
A thousand won left!
(Her cellular phone ringing during his shower bath)
Gyeon-woo:
Hello?
Gyeon-woo:
This phone's owner?
Gyeon-woo:
She's sleeping beside me.
Gyeon-woo:
What?
Here?
Gyeon-woo:
The Uk-su motel near Bupyung station.
(Phone's cut off)
Gyeon-woo:
Better wash and leave fast.
(Gyeon-woo's amazed at his own looks in the mirror) Aha~!
(The door's opened with a bang)
Woman cop 1 :
Hands in the air!
Woman cop 1 :
What are you doing?
Woman cop 1 :
Hands in the air!
Gyeon-woo:
Aaggh~~~~~~!
Gyeon-woo:
No, I'm not, sir!
Gyeon-woo:
I told you.
I'm an innocent victim.
Policeman:
Talk about it later and get in there.
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, damn!
I'm gonna die mad!
Policeman:
Come over here.
Come on!
Gyeon-woo:
Please forgive me just this once.
Gyeon-woo:
Please forgive me.
I can't get in there...
Gangsters:
How are you?
Gyeon-woo:
Please, please save my life!
Gangsters:

How are you?
Gyeon-woo:
Please just for once!
Please...
Gangsters:

Boss:
What's your name?
Gangster:
Answer now!
Boss told you!
Gyeon-woo:
Gyeon-woo, I'm Gyeon-woo.
Gangster:
What brought you here?
Gyeon-woo:
I'm innocent.
Gyeon-woo:
I'm telling the truth, sir!
Gangster:
So you're an innocent and we're fucking guilty, huh?
Gyeon-woo:
No, I don't mean that!
Gangster:
That's exactly what you said, motherfucker!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm gonna put it right.
I'm sorry.
Gangster:
You raped a girl, huh?
Gyeon-woo:
Nope!
No~~~!
Gangster:
Come on!
Shoot now, you little creep!
Gangster:
You wanna cut your finger or talk now?
Huh?
Gangster:
Be quick, he told you, you little bastard!
Gangster:
You turn against him, or what?
Boss:
All of you.
Boss:
Eat one a piece, okay?
Gangsters:
Yes, boss.
Gangster 2:
What are you looking at?
Look away.
Policeman 1 :
Gyeon-woo!
You're out!
Gyeon-woo:
Take care you guys!
Gangster:
Bye~!
Gangster:
And remember to keep in touch!
Gyeon-woo:
Uh...
Oh, yeah.
Gangster:
Don't just pass by us next time, all right?
Gyeon-woo:
Of course.
See you.
Boss:
Hey!
You come over here.
Boss:
Didn't I say eat one a piece!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm home.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Did you go to Bupyung?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes, I did.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Come here!
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Where did you sleep?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Your aunt said you didn't come!
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
And you're telling me a lie!
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
What happened to your sweater?
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I'm such a poor guy.
All this cause of a drunk girl.
I wanna die.
Gyeon-woo:(Running away) You asked if I went to Bupyung!
Gyeon-woo:
I did, but not to see auntie!
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
What?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Bastard!
Wait till he comes back.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Know me now, right?
I'm a typical student.
An engineering major.
Study?
I'm smart, but I never study.
My parents can prove that.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
You're smart like me, but studying is your problem.
Gyeon-woo's Father:
Since you inherited your brain from me,
Gyeon-woo's Father:you'll get good grades if you study harder, idiot.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Up four points in three years.
Gyeon-woo's Father:
Call this a report card?
Gyeon-woo's Father:
Since you inherited your brain from your mom,
Gyeon-woo's Father:you'll get good grades if you study harder.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) If you raise kids, never tell them they're smart.
They'll never study.
My goals?
Haven't thought about it yet.
You know now?
You got it.
I'm a hopeless student.
(Gyeon-woo's cellular phone ringing)
Gyeon-woo:
Hello?
Girl:
Who are you, asshole?
Gyeon-woo:
What?
Who's calling?
Girl:
Why were you naked in a motel with me?
Gyeon-woo:
What?
Girl:
Come out!
Girl:
To Bupyung station now!
Gyeon-woo:
Uh...
(Cell phone hangs up)
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) How could she do this?
I went to jail and got beaten with a vacuum for her.
Gyeon-woo:(Hesitating) Excuse me.
Girl:
Is it you?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes?
Girl:
Follow me.
Girl:
Get over here.
Girl:
What do you wanna eat?
Gyeon-woo:
Cherry Jubilee...
Gyeon-woo:
Mango Tango or Shooting Stars...
Gyeon-woo:
Jamonka Almonds good, too.
Gyeon-woo:
I'll just have a Love Me.
Girl:
Hey, wanna die?
Girl:
Drink coffee.
Girl:
Two coffees.
Girl:
You pay for it.
Girl:
Tell me.
Girl:
What happened last night?
Gyeon-woo:(Stammering) Well, it's...
Gyeon-woo:
You were drunk, so...
Girl:
Don't stumble, and speak clearly!
Gyeon-woo:
You see.
Gyeon-woo:
You were drunk and staggering at the subway station.
Gyeon-woo:
I saved you from the train.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I thought maybe this girl was a snake.
Pretending to be drunk and vomiting to use the guy in a state of confusion.
Girl:
So I called you honey?
Gyeon-woo:
That's right.
Girl:
I kind of remember that.
Girl:
You showered to wash off vomit and sweat,
Girl:and the police came?
Gyeon-woo:
That's right.
Girl:
Would you believe that, too?
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) To a girl like this, you need to show her who's the boss.
Girl:
So I did that, right?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes, you did.
Waitress:(Serving coffee) Sorry, it's late.
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah...
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) When she's not drunk, she's just my type.
Gyeon-woo:
You look prettier and livelier than yesterday.
Girl:
Are you mocking me?
Gyeon-woo:(Embarrassed) No, I'm not.
Girl:
Then are you hitting on me?
Girl:(Directly) I don't wanna date you.
Girl:
We're not destined for each other.
Girl:
Throw the trash away.
Gyeon-woo:(Feeling absurd) Damn it.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I think she's a heavy drinker.
Girl:
You order.
Gyeon-woo:
Kimchi soup and Soju, please.
Girl:(Throwing a menu card) Eat Golbangee.
Gyeon-woo:(Grumbling) Then you should order.
Girl:(Girl in anger) Stop pouting!
Girl:
Golbangee, please.
Man 1 :

Teenage girl 1 :

Teenage girl 1 :
A motel?
Are you rich?

Of course.
Teenage girl 1 :
How much will you give us?
Man 2:
We'll see, so don't worry.
Girl:
You kids are prostituting, huh?
Girl:
Why'd you order Golbangee?
Eat something else!
Teenage girl 1 :
What's it to you?
Mind your own business.
Man 1 :
We're just having a drink with some friends.
What's wrong?
Girl:
You take friends to a motel?
Girl:
How old are you kids?
Teenage girl 2:
Old enough to drink.
Mind your own business.
Girl:
Think I'm doing this 'cause you're drinking?
Girl:
Show me your ID.
You, too.
Teenage girl 1 :
What's with you?
Girl:
Show it, now.
Teenage girl 1 :
This sucks.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) She's a vicious chick.
No matter how pretty she is,
I'm too embarrassed to be with her.
Man 2:
Who are you to butt in other people's business?
Girl:
Don't you have a daughter?
/Man 2:
I don't.
Bear me one.
Girl:
Who the hell do you think you are?
Man 2:
How dare you?
/Girl:
Come on, let's fight!
Girl:
Come on!
I'll show you.
Girl:
Don't live like that!
Man 1 :
Catch the girls.
Gyeon-woo:(Pouring soju) Have a drink and calm down.
Girl:(Keeping drinking) Shit!
Girl:
Ah~!
Girl:(Sobbing out) Huk~!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Seeing a girl cry makes me sad for some reason.
She's more attractive the closer I look at her.
Girl:
Did you blow your nose on this?
Gyeon-woo:
No.
Girl:(Girl starting to cry) Huk~ huk~ huk~~~!
Gyeon-woo:
Please stop crying.
Gyeon-woo:
Also...
Gyeon-woo:
The handkerchief is mine.

Girl:
I broke up with my boyfriend yesterday.
Gyeon-woo:
Excuse me.
Gyeon-woo:
Wake up.
Gyeon-woo:
Come on, wake up.
Innkeeper:
Your fiances wasted again?
Gyeon-woo:
What now?
Innkeeper:
Sign you in like before, right?
Gyeon-woo:

Gyeon-woo:
But mister, have any medicine for alcohol?
Innkeeper:
No, you buy it.
Woman:
Where did you go, honey?
Woman:(ln amazement) Ugh~!
Ooh~!
Man:
What!
What is it?
/Gyeon-woo:
Uh!
Girl:(Girl vomiting) Ooh-ack!
Gyeon-woo:(Gyeon-woo feeling sick at the girl) Ack!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I saw her lips.
Her white neck.
And...
I saw her breast, too.
While watching her sleep like a baby, it may be forward, but this occurred to me.
I want to heal her sorrow.
Girl:
Give me some water.
Girl:(Getting up) Hey.
Girl:
Why am I here?
Gyeon-woo:
You see.
Gyeon-woo:
I'm sorry,
Gyeon-woo:but I saw your ID, and you're twenty-four.
Gyeon-woo:
If you talk down on me again...
Girl:
So what are you gonna do?
Just that...
Gyeon-woo:
Nothing.
Girl:
Give me the towel.
Gyeon-woo:
Yes.
You see, I'm a year older.
Girl:
Then talk like friends.
/Gyeon-woo:

Toothbrush.
Gyeon-woo:
Toothpaste?
Gyeon-woo:
In the bathroom.

But she's still pretty.
/Friend 2:

I said leave.
Gyeon-woo:
Why?
Professor:
Wasn't that girl your girlfriend?
(Friends' jeer)
Professor:
So go see her.
(Friends' jeer again)
Gyeon-woo:
Thank you, sir.
Professor:
Oh, Gyeon-woo.
Professor:
If you can, raise it with her.

Gyeon-woo:
What did you tell him?
Girl:
That I'm getting an abortion, and you're the father.
Girl:
What?
Gyeon-woo:(Screaming) No, no!
Professor, it's not true!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) She wanted to be a scriptwriter, so she kept writing stories.
She called them synopsis.
To get me into the mood, she took me to the park to read them.
Reading her synopsis was stressful.
If I miss anything, I'm dead.
Girl:
Wanna die?
Finish reading it.
Gyeon-woo:
I will.
Girl:(flying into a rage) Mister!
How could you throw the butt here?
Girl:
Pick it up!
Girl:
And why did you wear that color?
Man on the street:
Then what about you?
Girl:
Don't wear the same color as mine!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) The heroine is tough, like the 'Terminator'.
The year is 2137.
Villains kidnap her lover and travels to the present.

To save her lover, she travels in a time machine to the present.

You don't know movies.
Gyeon-woo:
Koreans like melodramas.
Girl:
Why?
Gyeon-woo:
Know what novel touched us when we were teenagers?
Gyeon-woo:'Shower' by Hwang Sun-won.
Gyeon-woo:
It shaped our people's sensibility in their teens.
Gyeon-woo:
Koreans like sad movies all because of 'Shower'.
Girl:'Shower'?
What's sad about it?
Gyeon-woo:
It's sad when she asked
Gyeon-woo:to be buried in the clothes reminiscent of her love.
Gyeon-woo:
I couldn't sleep for one week.
Girl:
The ending sucks.
Girl:
Gotta change it.
Gyeon-woo:
How?
Gyeon-woo's Father:
It's sad.
Her family couldn't afford to pay for her medicine.
Gyeon-woo's Father:
Their family line is broken up now.
Gyeon-woo's Father:
But you know, she must have been an extraordinary girl.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Why?
Gyeon-woo's Father:
This was her last request.
Gyeon-woo's Father:
When I die, please bury me with my loving friend.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:(Surprised) What?

I think I'll never get over him.
Girl:
How deep could it be?
Gyeon-woo:
I don't know.
Girl:
Gyeon-woo, go in the water.
Girl:
I wanna know how deep it is.
Gyeon-woo:

Taxi driver:
Hey, money!
Girl:
Ooh!
Damn it!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Since I'm drunk,
I decided to take revenge on her.
If I'm out cold at Bupyung station, then she'll have to carry me on her back.
(On the air) This stop is Bupyung station...
Cleaning Lady:
Hey, kid.

Girl:
You're very happy to see me, aren't you?
Girl:
Be good to me...
Girl:and you'll always be with good luck.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) lf I sleep out, mom beats me with whatever's in her hands.
If she's sweeping, it's a broom stick.
If she's cleaning, it's a vacuum.
When I'm lucky, it's a cucumber or eggplant.
So I have to come at the right time.
(The sound of fulling cloth)
Gyeon-woo's Father:
You studying now?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes, I'm.
I'm looking over something on the Internet.

Girl:
Since I like you so much, better make me smile like this.
* * ____
Girl:
Got it?
Gyeon-woo:
I got it.
Gyeon-woo:(Sigh) Phew~~
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Her birthday.
If I prepare nothing, she may murder me.
I have a good idea.
Before going to the service, I worked in a theme park.
So this is my plan.
At midnight, I'll be alone with her in the park.
It'll be completely dark all around us.
One by one, the lights to the merry-go-round flick on.
I raise my arms up there, and her birthday song starts.
Then all the lights turn on and it moves.
There's fireworks, too.
Isn't it fantastic?
She'll be thrilled.
(Laughing)
I gave 200,000 won to my friends working there.
Girl:
Jump over here?
/Gyeon-woo:
Yeah.
We have to.
Gyeon-woo:
I always wanted to come here at night.
Girl:
It's my birthday, not yours.
Gyeon-woo:
Please, let's just try.
Gyeon-woo:
I'll go up first and help you.
Gyeon-woo:
Eh?
There's a step here.
Gyeon-woo:
Take my hand.
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, shit!
(Tumbling down)
Gyeon-woo:
Shit!
(Surprised at a deserter)
Girl:
Gyeon-woo.
Girl:
Hey!
Girl:
Answer me.
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
Girl:
Answer me!
Gyeon-woo!
You're dead.
Girl:
Wait till I catch you.
Girl:
Why didn't you answer?
Girl:
Wanna die?
Deserter:
Come with me!
(The sound of car passing by)
Deserter:
Hurry and get in.
(Gyeon-woo screaming)
Deserter:
Shut up!
Deserter:
Go in fast.
Move it.
Sit here.
Deserter:
If you're loud, I'll kill you.
Got it?
Gyeon-woo:(Sobbing) Yes.
Deserter:
Answer quietly!
/Gyeon-woo:(quietly) Yes.
(Gyeon-woo startled at her)
Girl:
Is that a real gun?
Deserter:
Wanna see?
/Girl:
Forget it.
Deserter:
How are you two related?
Gyeon-woo:
We're just friends.
Deserter:
Really?
You mean she could be my pussy?
Girl:
What?
Your pussy?
Girl:
I'm not a cat or anything!
Go ahead and apologize!
Deserter:
Alright.
I'll do it.
I'm sorry.
Deserter:
Anyway, friends come here late at night?
Deserter:
Why are you here?
Gyeon-woo:(Stammering) We just wanted to come here at night.
Deserter:
Tell me the truth, idiot.
/Gyeon-woo:
Nothing special.
Deserter:
Bullshit.
Deserter:
What makes you trust a guy like him?
Girl:
I trusted myself.
Deserter:(Sigh) I had a girlfriend, too.
Deserter:
She visited me every week for one year.
Deserter:
I was so happy.
Deserter:
But that bitch fell in love with the guard house sergeant.
Deserter:
I found out the fact after he was discharged.
Deserter:(Sobbing) Damn it.
Deserter:
While I'm in the service, even my dog...
Deserter:ran away with some mutt, too.
Deserter:
My Yorkshire Terrier.
Bitch.
Deserter:
Fuck.
I came out to kill both bitches.
Fuck.
Deserter:
I have the worst luck in this world.
Deserter:
Damn it.
Deserter:
Know what special day is it today?
Deserter:
Huh, damn it?
This sucks!
(A deserter screaming)
(As if feeling sick) Uuuuuuuhhh~ ack!
Girl:
Hey, what are the odds to meet a runaway soldier in a park?
Gyeon-woo:
Don't know.
Girl:
Heard your head blows up if you shoot in the mouth.
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah, the hole in your head is this big.
Girl:
That's serious.
A teeny bullet does that?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah, the bullet tears the...
Deserter:
Hey!
What are you two doing?
Deserter:
Stop joking around.
Deserter:
Damn it.
Damn it!
Deserter:
Even you bastards ignore me.
Girl:
That's why don't be foolish.
/Deserter:
Why am I foolish?
Girl:
Even if you do this, she won't come back.
Deserter:
I know.
I know, too.
Deserter:
But if I die, she'll be heartbroken.
Deserter:
She'll never be the same.
Girl:
You're wrong.
Girl:
The pain goes away sooner than you think.
Deserter:
You went through something like this?
Girl:
Yeah.
It happens that way.
Deserter:
Damn it.
If I'm caught, I'll go to the can.
Deserter:
I'll always think of her there.
Girl:
What does 'can' mean?
Gyeon-woo:
It means prison.
Deserter:
Don't interrupt.
/Gyeon-woo:
Sorry.
Girl:
Anyway, you're responsible for your actions now.
Gyeon-woo:
Excuse me, sir.
Gyeon-woo:
How about letting her go?
Deserter:
If I say no?
Gyeon-woo:
Then...
Gyeon-woo:...
let me go, instead.
Deserter:
Come to think of it,
Deserter:your eyebrows remind me of that sergeant.
Deserter:
You act like him, too.
Deserter:
You can go.
Deserter:
And you...
Deserter:
We die together.
Got it?
Gyeon-woo:
Pardon?
Deserter:
Hey, lady.
Forget about this bastard, and look for a nice guy.
Got it?
Deserter:
Go!
/Girl:
let's go together.
Girl:
All three of us.
Deserter:
Will you leave if I kill him?
Girl:
Gyeon-woo.
Don't worry too much.
Girl:
This soldier isn't a bad guy.
Girl:
You'll come out safely.
Gyeon-woo:(Sobbing) You're leaving me alone?
Girl:
There's no other way.
Deserter:
I was afraid to die alone, but I'm glad we're in it together.
(The sound of radio signal)
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, right.
Gyeon-woo:
Over there,
Gyeon-woo:there's an exit near the merry-go-round.
Gyeon-woo:
Nobody knows about it.
Gyeon-woo:
I used to work here.
Deserter:
Really?
Deserter:
You're not tricking me, right?
Gyeon-woo:
I'm a man, too.
Why would I?
Deserter:
Walk in front of me.
Gyeon-woo:
See?
I told you so.
(The radio signal)
Soldier 1 :
This way!
Deserter:
Shit!

Friend 1 :
What's going on?
It's Gyeon-woo.
Deserter:
Screw you!
Don't come closer!
Deserter:
I'll kill him!
I'll really kill him!

Deserter:
Tell that bitch to come!
So she can see me die!
Deserter:
I'll give you an hour!
Deserter:
If not, I'll kill him, and myself, too!
Deserter:
Got it?

Hurry up!
Radio:
Sniper 2!
Sniper:
The hostage is in danger, but we can still fire.
(Shooting)
Girl:
Don't!
Wait!
Don't shoot!
(The radio signal still going on)
Girl:
Hey, soldier!
I mean sir!
Girl:
Your girlfriend changed her mind, right?
Girl:
Did you really love her?
Girl:
Ask yourself.
Girl:
I think you didn't.
Girl:
If you really love her,
Girl:you should let her go.
Girl:
If not, then it's not love.
Girl:
What's wrong with someone you don't love getting married?
Girl:
Stop this,
Girl:and go back to base as a real man.
Girl:
A person like you should learn more about love.
Girl:(Crying)If we want to learn,
Girl:then we should keep living.
Deserter:(Crying) Damn it.
Deserter:
She's the nicest girl I've met.
Deserter:
Hey!
Don't let her go.
Got it?
Deserter:
If you do, I'll take her.
Gyeon-woo:
Can I go?
/Deserter:
Go.
Screw it.
Friend 1 :
Shit!
Don't know.
(Fireworking) Pop!
Pop!
Deserter:
Thank you.
Today's my birthday.
Deserter:
I'll live on until I learn what love is.
Girl:
What?
We're just friends?
Gyeon-woo:
No, I said that to save you.
Girl:
let me go, instead?
Girl:
Wanted to save yourself, huh?
Gyeon-woo:
He wouldn't have let you go.
Girl:
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Girl:
Have a nice life alone.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I screwed up her birthday, but I feel good anyway.
'Cause I'm proud to be with her, and things turned out as planned.
I hope you believe in me.
You can't?
Wait...
Second Half
Waiter:
I remember.
Waiter:
She always came with him until last year.
Waiter:
Was it last spring or autumn?
Waiter:
One day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.
Waiter:
To not let anyone sit in his seat that day.
Girl:
What's up?
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, hi.
Girl:
You're early.
Gyeon-woo:
I was in the neighborhood.
Girl:
Miss me?
Gyeon-woo:
Of course!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) She always tried hard to look cheerful.
Gyeon-woo:
I like her that way.
/Waiter:
What would you like?
Gyeon-woo:
Coke, please.
Girl:
Wanna die?
Drink coffee.
Girl:
Two coffees, please.
(Gyeon-woo grinning) He he he~
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I know her.
She pretends to be happy, but she's full of sorrow inside.
Girl:
What are you doing?
What are you smiling at?
Gyeon-woo:
No.
It's nothing.
Girl:
looks fun, huh?
Gyeon-woo:
Another one?
/Girl:
Why?
Don't wanna read it?
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) She may get disappointed,
Gyeon-woo:but I should be honest for her sake.
Gyeon-woo:
looks fun.
I'll read it.
(Girl laughing brightly) Ha ha ha~
The heroine is a bounty hunter.
The villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.
The worst of his kind.
(People around a montage in commotion)
Man 1 :
What happened?
His name's Gyeon-woo?
Man 2:
Gyeon-woo?
Gyeon-woo:
The story's setting is a mess.
Japan invades during King Sejong's reign, and the king's father is the tyrant Yeonsan.
In the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.
Heavy rain pours down on a sunny day.
(Cunningly laugh) He he he~
(Gyeon-woo screaming and running for her) Yaaaah~
(Girl drawing a sword) Yup~!
The heroine becomes a king.
King Jung-jo.
She's from the future, of course.
Girl:
It's fun, huh?
Gyeon-woo:
Why is the heroine always from the future?
Girl:
Science is advanced then,
Girl:so they invent a time machine.
Girl:
And people go to the past to travel.
Girl:
People from the future could be here now.
Girl:
I think UFOs are time machines.
Girl:
Someday, I'll meet someone from the future.
Girl:
I have to.
Gyeon-woo:
If you do, ask him to take you.
Girl:
What?
Gyeon-woo:
If it's possible...
Girl:
Give this to Shin Cine.
Girl:
Tell them to cast Han Suk-gyu and Shim Eun-ha.
Girl:
Jeon Do-yun is okay, too.
Gyeon-woo:
Excuse me, we talked on the phone, right?
Gyeon-woo:
Well... this is 'The Warrior's Sad Love Story'...
(Man feeling like vomiting) Uuuuuuuugh~
(Man throwing up) Uuuh~ Aaaack~!
Gyeon-woo:
It's going to be a hit.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Shin Cine didn't call back.
Girl:
Hey!
Girl:
Hey, kid.
Girl:
Is the subway your sketch book?
Girl:
Don't scribble on it.
Wanna die?
Woman:
My lipstick!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I always take her home, even to Bupyung station.
It's something a man must do.
On the way, we play fun games, too.
Girl:
left foot over the line, I win.
Girl:
With the right foot, you win.
Gyeon-woo:
What's the prize?
Girl:
let's see...
Gyeon-woo:
How about a kiss?
Girl:(ln a loud voice) A kiss?
Girl:
Wanna die?
Gyeon-woo:
You choose.
Girl:
Hitting each other.
Gyeon-woo:
Again?
Girl:
You can hit me, too.
Gyeon-woo:
Okay.
Gyeon-woo:
Someone's coming.
(Gyeon-woo laughing) Ha ha ha~~~~~!
Girl:
I think this is unfair.
Girl:
I'm a girl, so I'll slap the cheek.
Gyeon-woo:
No.
Then I'll change it, too.
Girl:
But I'm a girl.
/Gyeon-woo:
Men and women are equal.
Girl:
Okay, then.
You slap, and I slap, too.
Girl:
Go easy on me, and I'll kill you.
Girl:
Better slap me on the cheek.
Girl:
If you don't, I'll kill you!
Gyeon-woo:
All right.
Gyeon-woo:
You slap, and I'll use my finger.
Girl:
Right, that's fair.
Girl:
Saw that?
Girl:
See that guy step over with his left foot?
Gyeon-woo:
I had my eyes closed.
Plus he came the opposite way.
Gyeon-woo:
I thought it was this way.
Girl:
Shut up.
Here they come.
A staff sergeant:
left foot.
Left foot.
Gyeon-woo:
It'll be the right foot.
A staff sergeant:
left!
Left!
Switch to the right.
Gyeon-woo:
You have to hit me?
Girl:
You know why the sky is blue?
Gyeon-woo:'Cause the reflection of the sunshine.
Girl:
Nope.
It's for me!
Girl:
I want it to be blue.
So, it's blue.
Girl:
You know why the fire is hot?
It's all for me.
Girl:
I want it to be hot.
So it is.
Girl:
You know why we have four seasons here in Korea.
Gyeon-woo:
Because of you.
/Girl:
That's correct!
Girl:
And why you were born here?
Girl:
It's for me as well.
/Gyeon-woo:
What?
Gyeon-woo:
That's nonsense.
I was born before you.
Girl:
You know the word of 'worship'?
Girl:'Peter came first in order to prepare for the birth of Jesus.' huh?
Gyeon-woo:
Well...
Yeah, I know.
Girl:
So, get ready!
Girl:
Come here.
Stay still.
/Gyeon-woo:
Ugh!
Uh uh uh~!
(Passengers surprised)
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) When I'm with her,
I never know how the day will turn out.
Girl:
What?
Girl:
What are you looking at?
Gyeon-woo:
I quit!
Girl:
Is your face a racket?
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Why does the ball always hit my face?
It's strange.
(Gyeon-woo screaming) Ugh~!
(Shouting)
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I never want to lose a game.
So I play until I win.
(Gyeon-woo screaming and running) Aaaaaaaaah~!
(Gyeon-woo groaning) Ugh!
Gyeon-woo:
Wait long?
Girl:
Just a teeny bit.
Girl:
My mom bought me these heels,
Girl:but they're killing my feet.
Gyeon-woo:
Want a massage?
Girl:
No, it's okay.
Girl:
Instead, let's exchange shoes.
Girl:
Don't wanna?
Gyeon-woo:
How can a guy wear heels?
Girl:
It'll fit.
Gyeon-woo:
But, I can't...
Girl:
Yeah?
I see.
Gyeon-woo:
Come on.
I'll buy you some sneakers.
Girl:
Forget it.
Gyeon-woo:
Then wear mine, and I'll carry yours.
Girl:
You don't understand women.
Gyeon-woo:
Okay!
Let's exchange.
Girl:
Really?
Girl:
Wanna know a secret?
Gyeon-woo:
What is it?
Girl:
I don't wear panties on exam day.
Girl:
But I had one today.
Girl:
Catch me, honey!
Girl:
Hey.
If you don't, I'll kill you.
Gyeon-woo:
Phew~ /Girl:
Catch me, honey~!
Gyeon-woo:
Stop right there!
Gyeon-woo:
Stop!
Umpire:
Out!
Gyeon-woo:(monolog) It was just a second, but I felt something in her eyes.
Girl:
That's my house.
Girl:
Wait.
I'll bring you an umbrella.
Gyeon-woo:
I'm okay.
I'm already wet so I'll just leave.
Gyeon-woo:
Eh?
Gee~
Girl's Father:
Are you my daughter's boyfriend?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes, sir.
Girl's Father:
How much do you know about my daughter?
Gyeon-woo:
Not much...
Girl's Father:
Next time, don't hang out till late.
Girl's Mom:
You don't understand me.
Girl's Mom:
Why'd you stand him up?
Girl's Mom:
What's wrong with him?
Why do you stand guys up?
Girl's Mom:
And what happened to your heels?
Girl's Mom:
What's wrong with you?
Girl's Mom:
I told you not to meet Gyeon-woo.
Girl's Mom:
He's dumb and has no future.
Girl:
It's none of your business.
Girl:
Why is he stupid?
Girl:
You're stupid so you don't know.
Girl's Mom:
What has gotten in to you?
Girl:
let me live my own life!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Afterwards,
I didn't hear from her for a long time.
(Cellular phone ringing)
Gyeon-woo:
Hello?
/Girl:
Gyeon-woo, it's me.
Girl:
long time no see.
Gyeon-woo:
Her voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.
Girl:
Our 100th day celebration is soon.
Gyeon-woo:
It's 100 days already?
Girl:
When do you think a girl's the prettiest?
Gyeon-woo:
When a sexy woman is naked.
Girl:
Where are you now?
Stay right there.
Gyeon-woo:
No, I'm just kidding.
Gyeon-woo:
The prettiest is when she's playing the piano.
Girl:
What's your favorite song?
Gyeon-woo:
That George Winston song.
(Gyeon-woo humming) Ta la la la la la~ Ta la~~~
Girl:
Pachelbel's 'Canon'?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah, that song.
Girl:
You're not gonna ask me?
Gyeon-woo:
When is the guy the prettiest?
Girl:
Just give me a rose.
Girl:
Still have your high school uniform?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah.
Why?
Girl:
Bring it on our 100th day,
Girl:and give me a rose during my class.
Girl:
Do it yourself, okay?
Gyeon-woo:
What?
What did you say?
How can I during class?
Gyeon-woo:
Hey!
Just hung up on me!
Damn it!
(Students shouting to be quiet)
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I don't wanna get beaten by her, or get humiliated at a women's college.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Oh my God!
A burglar!
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Help, a burglar!
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Eh?
Are you crazy?
You're gonna break into where?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
What on earth are you doing in broad daylight?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
And you...
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Why you didn't drop by an aunt's coming and going Bupyung for the girl.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
You never know how much hard time I went through for you.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
She even intends to introduce a girl to you.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Gyeon-woo!
Where are you going?
Gyeon-woo:
I'm cleverer than I look.
Gyeon-woo:
These girls sure love Chinese food.
Guard:
Hey, you!
Where you headed?
Come here!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm delivering Chinese food.
Guard:
I ordered it.
Bring it here.
Gyeon-woo:
Really?
Guard:
Bring a lot of radish?
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, I forgot something!
Guard:
Give me the food first!
That's the wrong way!
Gyeon-woo:
There's another customer.
Guard:
Hey!
(Classroom in commotion...) (becoming as silent as death...)
(Again in commotion)
(Pachelbel's 'Canon' begins to be played)
(Students clapping and shouting)
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) But that wasn't enough for her.
We relived our old high school days.
Girl:
Drink!
Drink till die!
Gyeon-woo:
I've never had anything like this.
Gee!
Gyeon-woo:
Sorry, I'm gonna drink it in my way.
Gyeon-woo:
Feeling so good!
Girl:
Have a smoke, too!
Gyeon-woo:
Wow, I've never had a smoke, either!
Gyeon-woo:
Gonna be a big deal.
I don't smoke well...
Gyeon-woo:
What are we supposed to do if caught by teacher.
Gyeon-woo:
It's a suspension!
Girl:
You've already had your ups and downs in life.
Girl:
Go ahead and smoke!
Gyeon-woo:
Hey, you are such a tough cookie!
Gyeon-woo:
You go to very good school!
Girl:
Not to worry.
Gyeon-woo:
This clothes is so tight!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) After we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.
But she got wasted again.
Condom man:
Oh, wild teens!
Here's a condom.
Condom man:
let's prevent AIDS.
Gyeon-woo:
Taxi!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) She's having a happy dream.
Compared to when I looked at her in the motel the first time, she looks so different.
Could her pain be cured now?
Maybe it means that she doesn't need me anymore.
Gyeon-woo:
Excuse me.
Can you drive slowly?
Girl's Father:
Here.
Girl's Father:
Have any plans after graduation?
Gyeon-woo:
Actually, I've never thought about it yet.
Girl's Father:
Can I see what's in your pocket?
Gyeon-woo:
Sir?
Right.
(Girl's Mom mumbling without sound) 'lt's a condom.'
Girl's Father:
What is this for?
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, right.
I learned that it prevents AIDS.
Gyeon-woo:
But I haven't used it yet.
Gyeon-woo:
Actually, on the way here.
/Girl's Father:
Forget it.
Girl's Father:'Chicks Hen'?
What does this mean?
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, right.
It's a chicken soup restaurant.
Girl's Father:'We'll satisfy all your wishes?
'
Gyeon-woo:
I think it's to satisfy our tastes.
Girl's Mom:(Without sound) 'Hurry and tell him.'
Girl's Father:
How do feel about our daughter?
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, right.
We're just friends now.
Gyeon-woo:
Please don't worry.
Gyeon-woo:
If we get closer, I'll let you know, sir.
Girl's Father:
Don't see her any more.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) After that day, she never calls me.
It was sudden, but that's how we broke up.
We're broken up.
Now, I'm free.
(Cellular phone ringing)
Girl:
It's me.
Come to the cafe by seven o'clock.
Gyeon-woo:
Why?
Girl:
What?
I have a blind date today.
Girl:
Come in 45 minutes.
Gyeon-woo:
I have a blind date, too.
(Gyeon-woo surprised)
(Cellular phone ringing)
Girl:
Are you on your way?
Gyeon-woo:
I'm on a date with a girl.
Girl:
Hurry up.
Woman:
I have to go to the bathroom.
Gyeon-woo:'Gotta go to the bathroom.'
Gyeon-woo:(ln amazement) Eh?
(Gyeon-woo sobbing as he feels mistreated)
Gyeon-woo:
Nice to meet you.
Seok-won:
I'm Cha Seok-won.
Nice to meet you.
Gyeon-woo:
Same here.
/Seok-won:
Have a seat.
Girl:
Were you really with a girl?
Gyeon-woo:
No, I was with a guy.
Waiter:
Can I take your order?
Gyeon-woo:
Coffee, please.
Girl:
You can drink coke.
Gyeon-woo:
I'll drink coffee.
Seok-won:
Gyeon-woo.
You're very lucky.
Seok-won:
I heard a lot about you.
That you're close friend.
Gyeon-woo:
Friend...
Girl:
I need to go to the bathroom.
Girl:
How is he?
Gyeon-woo:
No idea...
but he looks nice.
Gyeon-woo:
He is not the man you broke up with, is he?
Girl:
How do you know?
Gyeon-woo:
When you see a new man...
Gyeon-woo:forget about the past, all right?
Girl:
How the hell do you know?
Gyeon-woo:
This necklace is given from your ex-boyfriend, isn't it?
Gyeon-woo:
You wouldn't wear it if you just broke up for nothing.
Gyeon-woo:
Considering your temper...
and you...
Gyeon-woo:used to tell that you couldn't get over him.
Gyeon-woo:
Does that mean he isn't here anymore in this world?
Girl:
That man is the one my mom introduced me to meet.
Girl:
She kept pushing me to meet him...
Girl:
Doesn't look bad guy, does he?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes.
Gyeon-woo:
Hey, listen!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm totally OK, but you should be obedient to man.
Gyeon-woo:
Man likes something more feminine.
Gyeon-woo:
And... don't drink a lot.
Gyeon-woo:
Some of guys aim at the girls intoxicated.
Gyeon-woo:
And it's all right with me, but to the other guys
Gyeon-woo:try to surrender for just once.
Gyeon-woo:... not try to win.
Good luck to you.
Girl:
Where's Gyeon-woo?
Seok-won:
He left already.
Seok-won:
He told me ten rules to follow.
Seok-won:
I have a good memory.
I'll recite them.
Seok-won:
First, don't ask her to be feminine.
And don't...
Gyeon-woo:
Second, don't let her drink over three glasses.
Gyeon-woo:
She'll beat someone.
Gyeon-woo:
At a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.
Gyeon-woo:
If she hits you, act like it hurts.
Gyeon-woo:
If it hurts, act like it doesn't.
Gyeon-woo:
On your 100th day together,
Gyeon-woo:give her a rose during her class.
Gyeon-woo:
She'll like it a lot.
Gyeon-woo:
Make sure you learn fencing and squash.
Gyeon-woo:
Also, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.
Gyeon-woo:
If she says she'll kill you,
Gyeon-woo:don't take it lightly.
You'll feel better.
Gyeon-woo:
If her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.
Gyeon-woo:
Finally, she likes to write.
Gyeon-woo:
Encourage her.
(Girl breathing hard)
(Station attendant) Ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention to here...
Girl:
Gyeon-woo.
Station attendant:
Step backward on the yellow line...
Girl:
Gyeon-woo!
Station attendant:... after passenger's getting off, take in order...
Girl:
Gyeon-woo!
Station attendant:...please use the next train.
Station attendant:
What's his name?
Girl:
Gyeon-woo.
I'll do it myself.
Girl:
Gyeon-woo.
Where are you?
I looked all over for you.
Girl:
Gyeon-woo.
Come to the escalator.
Okay?
Girl:
You're dead if you don't.
Hurry up.
Girl:
Who told you to hug me?
(Gyeon-woo screaming)
Girl:
Dummy.
You're supposed to dodge.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Sometimes I feel like I know her and sometimes I don't.
We're definitely standing at the crossroad now.
What's going on between us?
Can this relationship last forever?
(Doorbell ringing)
Girl's Father:
Who is it?
Girl:
It's me, Dad.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) She told me to write a letter and bring it.
To write it on paper.
To express my feelings,
I tried hard to find the right words.
When I first met her,
I wanted to cure her grief, but now I can't give her up.
I wish we can get serious.
I'm writing about these feelings.
She's probably writing about me now.
This is how we're preparing to split up.
(Bird twittering around)
Girl:
Gyeon-woo.
Girl:
See that mountain top?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah.
Girl:
Could someone hear me from there?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes, probably so.
Or probably not.
Girl:
Then go over there.
I'll shout here.
Girl:
If you hear, answer me.
Gyeon-woo:
You want me to go over there?
Girl:
Yeah.
Girl:
Gyeon-woo?
Girl:
Can you hear me?
Girl:
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry.
I really can't help it.
Girl:
Gyeon-woo.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry...
I can't help it.
Girl:
I thought I was different, but I'm just a helpless girl.
Girl:
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry.
(Crying)
Girl:
Did you bring your letter?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah.
Gyeon-woo:
What's that?
Girl:
A time capsule.
Girl:
We put our letters in it and bury it here.
Girl:
And two years later, let's meet here again.
Girl:
We'll read the letters that day,
Girl:and maybe we can find an answer then.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) This was her way of saying good-bye, and I kept repeating in my mind that two years isn't long.
Girl:
let's open this exactly two years later, at two, okay?
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) We can meet two years later.
When we meet then, we'll be different from what we are now.
We may become closer, or stay forever apart.
We can only choose one.
Girl:
Gyeon-woo.
You go first.
Girl:
let's separate here.
Gyeon-woo:
Should we go together?
Girl:
No, I'll take the next train.
I think that's better.
Gyeon-woo:
See you two years later!
Girl:
Okay, in two years!
Gyeon-woo:
Two years!
Gyeon-woo:
Bye!
Girl:
Gyeon-woo!
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) That's how we broke up.
Overtime
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I couldn't endure the loneliness after we broke up.
Thinking of those memories,
I started to write about our stories on the Internet.
Then I made up my mind.
If I meet her again, I'll show her a different myself.
Got to make use of my time.
For her and my future's sake.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Why does the ball I hit keep hitting my face?
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) I wrote our stories on the Internet everyday, and I kept myself busy for two years.
(Gulp... gulp...) (Shouting) Yu~p!
Gyeon-woo:
Excuse me.
I wrote 'My Sassy Girl'.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) Shin Cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.
I made her dream come true instead.
I wanted to tell her right away, but I can only wait till that day.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) She didn't come.
It's our only day to meet.
No one knows when she will come.
(Gyeon-woo crying out in surprise) Wow!
Gyeon-woo:
How did he get in here?
Gyeon-woo:
It's a mystery.
Girl:
Gyeon-woo!
How are you?
I was so happy while being with you.
I'm not sure if you knew, but the person I loved passed away.
The day when I first met you was the day he died a year ago.
Actually, I tried to look for him in you.
I know it was wrong.
I'm sorry.
I also met him on the subway like you.
I was really sick at that time.
He did everything I wanted.
Like you did to me.
Under this tree, we planned our future together.
But he suddenly passed away.
While I was dating you, I met his mother often.
She wanted to introduce a nice man to me, but I couldn't.
The day I first met you, I came under this tree, and I prayed to him.
To let me free.
When I met you, this occurred to me.
That maybe...
he introduced you to me.
But the more I met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.
The more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.
While the two of us are apart,
I want to forget him alone.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) After that day, I went often to this place.
Girl:
If I'm not with you after two years, it means I still lack of courage.
How much will we change after two years?
I feel like you live in the future, and I stay in the past.
I want to meet you soon, so I can read your letter.
Girl:
Why are you staring at me, sir?
Old man:
Because you're so pretty.
I thought an angel came down.
Girl:
Do you come here often?
Old man:
Sometimes.
This tree has a secret.
Girl:
I have a secret here, too.
Old man:
Really?
Girl:
Three years ago, I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.
Girl:
What's your secret?
Old man:
So what happened?
Girl:
We promised to read the letters a year ago.
Girl:
But I couldn't come.
Old man:
I guess you're a year late.
Girl:
But two years didn't seem that long.
Girl:
I haven't made any decision yet.
Girl:
I just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.
Old man:
like what?
Girl:
If we were destined to meet,
Girl:
I thought we'd meet by chance somewhere.
Old man:
Know what fate is?
Old man:
Building a bridge of chance for someone you love.
Old man:
To be honest, I read you guys letters.
Old man:
I said this tree had a secret, right?
Girl:
Yes.
Old man:
look closely.
Does this tree look the same as before?
Girl:
Well, it looks like it changed a bit.
But I'm not sure.
Old man:
People are dead or alive.
Old man:
There's a dead tree and a living tree, too.
Old man:
This tree was struck dead by lightning last year.
Old man:
It was split into two.
Old man:
But this young man felt sorry for it.
Old man:
During this spring,
Old man:he planted another tree that looked the same.
Old man:
When he planted the tree,
Old man:he asked me if it look the same.
Old man:
He said that someone would be sad if it died,
Old man:so no one should know.
Girl:
Gyeon-woo...
(Recorded mechanical voice) You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
Girl:
Hi.
Woman:
It's been a while.
You've gotten prettier.
Girl:
You still look young.
How have you been?
Woman:
You were in England?
Girl:
Yes.
For one and a half years.
Girl:
So I can forget him.
Woman:
I see.
Feel better?
Girl:
Yes.
A lot better.
Woman:
Is it true now?
Woman:
My son might be sad.
Girl:
He won't.
He'll like it this way.
Woman:
Good, that's what I really hoped.
Gyeon-woo:
Auntie!
I was getting my photo taken.
Auntie:
You naughty boy.
Auntie:
Know how long it's been?
Auntie:
Sorry I didn't tell you before.
Auntie:
This is Gyeon-woo.
Doesn't he resemble him?
Auntie:
When you had a hard time,
Auntie:
I tried to introduce you to him for several years,
Auntie:but he kept getting out of it.
Auntie:
Heard you came to Bupyung often,
Auntie:but you never visited me?
Auntie:
Go out with him.
Auntie:
I thought he'd make things easy for you.
Auntie:
Oh, yeah.
Gyeon-woo, you're going to England, right?
Auntie:
She's already been there, so she can give you some tips.
Gyeon-woo:
I don't have to go now.
Auntie:
Why?
You two know each other?
Girl:
You may not believe it, but I think I met a man from the future.
Girl:
From your future.
Gyeon-woo:(Monolog) This is how I met her again.
Think it's too coincidental?
It's building a bridge of chance for your love.

MY SASSY GIRL
Exactly two years ago today, she and I buried a time capsule here.
We promised to meet here two years later, but she hasn't come yet.
I'm going to wait.
Here we go.
Please don't move.
One, two...
Wait a minute.
Hello?
Oh, auntie.
Sorry, I'm on my way.
I'm really sorry.
Yes, I'm coming.
I'm having my photo taken.
Bye.
Are you ready?
Here we go.
One, two...
My parents wanted a daughter, so they raised me like one.
So I thought I was a girl until I was seven.
I had to go to the women's public bath, too.
The older I got,
I thought my penis would get smaller and disappear.
But it was the opposite.
First Half
He hasn't changed at all.
No, I'm a real man now.
Hey, asshole.
Think clerical work in the army makes you a man?
You irritate me!
Give me a break, asshole.
My job was tougher than you could imagine.
Hey!
I worked near the DMZ.
Who are you kidding?
Hold it.
Anyway, welcome back home.
She's just my type.
When I see my type, I can't help it.
I need to hit on her.
Who's interrupting me?
Hello?
Who is this?
Your mother, you bastard. /Oh, mom...
Why aren't you at your aunt's house?
I'm leaving soon.
Keep quiet!
It's my mom!
Talk over there!
Make sure you pay a visit.
It's been over a year since you saw her.
That long?
You know she feels lonely after losing her son last year.
She says you resemble him.
She'll be so glad to see you.
Still there?
We don't look alike.
Plus, I hate when she rubs my face and kisses me.
Uncle does, too.
She'll introduce you to a girl.
Hey!
I know the type she likes.
Tell her no thanks.
I want to meet a girl like the ones in romantic comic books.
But on that day...
She's my type, but I don't like her.
Why?
Drunk girls disgust me.
Hey, get up!
Offer your seat to the elderly!
Ugh!
Go!
Hey.
Don't wear pink.
Honey!
She call him honey!
I'm not...
What are you doing!
I'm not...
You handle this!
I'm not...
Think I'm stupid?
Come here!
Are you laughing?
Why didn't you look after her?
Hurry and do something!
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Let me help with cleaning expenses.
Forget it.
Just take care of her.
Nothing's there when you need it.
Where did all those motels go?
I hate being with a drunk girl.
Carrying her on my back is worse.
Wow, your honey's wasted.
No, it's not my fault.
Of course, it is.
I know everything.
You see, we're engaged.
Western or Korean style?
Give me any room.
Room 405.
None on the first floor?
Fourth floor!
You forgot to check in.
It's 40,000 won, kid.
What?
40,000 won?
Why?
Find another place then.
Count it.
624... 770
Shindang-dong, Joong-gu...
Seoul...
Hey, why do you keep reading this?
016... 228... 53...
Oh, please...
A thousand won left!
Hello?
This phone's owner?
She's sleeping beside me.
What?
Here?
The Uk-su motel near Bupyung station.
Better wash and leave fast.
Aha!
Hands in the air!
What are you doing?
Hands in the air!
Aaggh!
No, I'm not, sir!
I told you.
I'm an innocent victim.
Talk about it later and get in there.
Oh, damn!
I'm gonna die mad!
Come over here.
Come on!
Please forgive me just this once.
Please forgive me.
I can't get in there...
How are you?
please, please save my life!
Hi?
How are you?
Please just for once!
Please...
See you!
What's your name?
Answer now!
Boss told you!
Gyeon-woo, I'm Gyeon-woo.
What brought you here?
I'm innocent.
I'm telling the truth, sir!
So you're an innocent and we're fucking guilty, huh?
No, I don't mean that!
That's exactly what you said, Motherfucker!
I'm gonna put it right.
I'm sorry.
You raped a girl, huh?
Nope!
No!
Come on!
Shoot now, you little creep!
You wanna cut your finger or talk now?
Huh?
Be quick, He told you, you little bastard!
You turn against him, or what?
All of you.
Eat one a piece, okay?
Yes, boss.
What are you looking at?
Look away.
Gyeon-woo!
You're out!
Take care you guys!
Bye!
And remember to keep in touch!
Uh...
Oh, yeah.
Don't just pass by us next time, all right?
Of course.
See you.
Hey!
You come over here.
Didn't I say eat one a piece!
I'm home.
Did you go to Bupyung?
Yes, I did.
Come here!
Where did you sleep?
Your aunt said you didn't come!
And you're telling me a lie!
What happened to your sweater?
I'm such a poor guy.
All this because of a drunk girl.
I wanna die.
You asked if I went to Bupyung!
I did, but not to see auntie!
What?
Bastard!
Wait till he comes back.
Know me now, right?
I'm a typical student.
An engineering major.
Study?
I'm smart, but I never study.
My parents can prove that.
You're smart like me, but studying is your problem.
Since you inherited your brain from me, you'll get good grades if you study harder, idiot.
Up four points in three years.
Call this a report card?
Since you inherited your brain from your mom, you'll get good grades if you study harder.
If you raise kids, never tell them they're smart.
They'll never study.
My goals?
Haven't thought about it yet.
You know now?
You got it.
I'm a hopeless student.
Hello?
Who are you, asshole?
What?
Who's calling?
Why were you naked in a motel with me?
What?
Come out!
To Bupyung station now!
Uh...
How could she do this?
I went to jail and got beaten with a vacuum for her.
Excuse me.
Is it you?
Yes?
Follow me.
Get over here.
What do you wanna eat?
Cherry jubilee...
Mango Tango or Shooting Stars...
Jamonka Almonds good, too.
I'll just have a Love Me.
Hey, wanna die?
Drink coffee.
Two coffees.
You pay for it.
Tell me.
What happened last night?
Well, it's...
You were drunk, so...
Don't stumble, and speak clearly!
You see.
You were drunk and staggering at the subway station.
I saved you from the train.
I thought maybe this girl was a snake.
Pretending to be drunk and vomiting to use the guy in a state of confusion.
So I called you honey?
That's right.
I kind of remember that.
You showered to wash off vomit and sweat, and the police came?
That's right.
Would you believe that, too?
To a girl like this, you need to show her who's the boss.
So I did that, right?
Yes, you did.
Sorry, it's late. /Yeah...
When she's not drunk, she's just my type.
You look prettier and livelier than yesterday.
Are you mocking me?
No, I'm not.
Then are you hitting on me?
I don't wanna date you.
We're not destined for each other.
Throw the trash away.
Damn it.
I think she's a heavy drinker.
You order.
Kimchi soup and Soju, please.
Eat Golbangee.
Then you should order.
Stop pouting!
Golbangee, please.
Let's go somewhere fun later.
I know what that means.
A motel?
Are you rich?
/ Of course.
How much will you give us?
We'll see, so don't worry.
You kids are prostituting, huh?
Why'd you order Golbangee?
Eat something else!
What's it to you?
Mind your own business.
We're just having a drink with some friends.
What's wrong?
You take friends to a motel?
How old are you kids?
Old enough to drink.
Mind your own business.
Think I'm doing this 'cause you're drinking?
Show me your ID.
You, too.
What's with you?
Show it, now.
This sucks.
She's a vicious chick.
No matter how pretty she is,
I'm too embarrassed to be with her.
Who are you to butt in other people's business?
Don't you have a daughter?
/ I don't.
Bear me one.
Who the hell do you think you are?
How dare you?
/Come on, let's fight!
Come on!
I'll show you.
Don't live like that!
Catch up with the girls.
Have a drink and calm down.
Shit!
Ah!
Seeing a girl cry makes me sad for some reason.
She's more attractive the closer I look at her.
Did you blow your nose on this?
No.
Please stop crying.
Also...
The handkerchief is mine.
To be honest,
I broke up with my boyfriend yesterday.
Excuse me.
Wake up.
Come on, wake up.
Your fiances wasted again?
What now?
Sign you in like before, right?
Yes.
But mister, have any medicine for alcohol?
No, you buy it.
Where did you go, honey?
What!
What is it?
/ Uh!
I saw her lips.
Her white neck.
And...
I saw her breast, too.
While watching her sleep like a baby, it may be forward, but this occurred to me.
I want to heal her sorrow.
Give me some water.
Hey.
Why am I here?
You see.
I'm sorry, but I saw your ID, and you're twenty-four.
If you talk down on me again...
So what are you gonna do?
Just that...
Nothing.
Give me the towel.
Yes.
You see, I'm a year older.
Then talk like friends. /Yeah?
Toothbrush.
Toothpaste?
In the bathroom.
Our relationship is so peculiar.
We met only three days ago, and slept twice in a motel.
That's how our relationship began.
Lee Hyung-chuI.
Here.
Jeun Mi-young.
Here.
Kang Man-gyu.
Yep.
Gyeon-woo.
Is he absent?
No, no!
I'm here!
Then answer right away.
Phew!
Gonna be sucks!
Lee Jeung-min.
Here.
Gu SeoI-soo.
(In a dialect) Yes, I'm here.
Professor.
How about a break?
You're right.
Let's take a break.
Let's go.
Go where?
Class isn't over yet.
Don't be a coward.
He called roll, right?
Let's go.
I can't.
I can't miss this class.
Kill me instead.
All right.
Who is she?
She's pretty.
Pretty?
Doesn't matter.
A girl needs to act pretty.
But she's still pretty. / Nice body, too.
Who's Gyeon-woo?
It's me, sir.
I won't mark you absent so you can leave.
Pardon me?
I said leave.
Why?
Wasn't that girl your girlfriend?
So go see her.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, Gyeon-woo.
If you can, raise it with her.
It worked.
What did you tell him?
That I'm getting an abortion, and you're the father.
What?
No, no!
Professor, it's not true!
She wanted to be a scriptwriter, so she kept writing stories.
She called them synopsis.
To get me into the mood, she took me to the park to read them.
Reading her synopsis was stressful.
If I miss anything, I'm dead.
Wanna die?
Finish reading it.
I will.
Mister!
How could you throw the butt here?
Pick it up!
And why did you wear that color?
Then what about you?
Don't wear the same color as mine!
The heroine is tough, like the 'Terminator'.
The year is 2137.
Villains kidnap her lover and travels to the present.
I don't know why.
To save her lover, she travels in a time machine to the present.
They have to kiss in the end.
This isn't a melodrama.
It's an action movie.
You don't know movies.
Koreans like melodramas.
Why?
Know what novel touched us when we were teenagers?
Shower by Hwang Sun-won.
It shaped our people's sensibility in their teens.
Koreans like sad movies all because of 'Shower'.
Shower?
What's sad about it?
It's sad when she asked to be buried in the clothes reminiscent of her love.
I couldn't sleep for one week.
The ending sucks.
Gotta change it.
How?
It's sad.
Her family couldn't afford to pay for her medicine.
Their family line is broken up now.
But you know, she must have been an extraordinary girl.
Gyeon-woo's mother:
Why?
This was her last request.
When I die, please bury me with my loving friend.
Gyeon-woo's mother:
What?
To bury him alive, even.
Oh, my gosh.
What's the matter?
/ What's wrong?
No way!
This is wrong!
This is wrong!
This is wrong!
Please.
Don't!
Bury him!
They bury him alive.
Isn't it sad?
I must be hurt still.
I think I'll never get over him.
How deep could it be?
I don't know.
Gyeon-woo, go in the water.
I wanna know how deep it is.
Come on.
Help me!
Help me!
Wow, it's deep.
I can't swim!
Yes, it's deep...
My mind was getting blurry.
At that moment...
Heard you got a girlfriend.
Introduce me.
Really?
/ I'm serious.
Is she pretty?
Have you kissed her?
Girlfriend?
Gonna introduce me or not?
She really pretty?
What are you looking at?
See that girl over there?
She's my girlfriend from today.
Got it?
Hey...
Excuse me...
Hey, baby.
Are you free?
/ Hey?
What?
Baby?
Hey!
Come here.
Hmm!
How could a coincidence like this happen?
Reportedly say there is an accident of runaway soldier...
Hello?
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
Let's drink.
Drink till we die.
1 hours ago It's me.
Where are you?
What are you doing?
Meeting your friends?
Can't I join us, can I?
Why not?
I wanna see your friends!
Hey!
Hey!
Now, you're dead.
Excuse me...
You've just forgotten your things.
Oh my gosh!
It's kind of you, thanks.
Do you want me to hold it for you?
Oh no.
That's all right. /All right then.
I'll help you, ma'am.
Oh, thank you. /No problem.
Watch your step!
Hey, money!
Ooh!
Damn it!
Since I'm drunk,
I decided to take revenge on her.
If I'm out cold at Bupyung station, then she'll have to carry me on her back.
This stop is Bupyung station...
Hey, kid.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Where am I?
I'm at Inchon station.
Be here in 30 minutes.
Wake up.
Get up, idiot.
Go away, buttbrain.
Talking back?
Get up, bastard!
/ What the...
How're you?
Hi!
How are you?
Oh, how is it going?
What?
Go away, buttbrain?
You got a bad mouth.
I'll set you straight the gangster's way.
On your head.
Get up.
Sit down.
Get up.
Sit down.
Roll right.
Roll left.
Do it right.
Keep going!
What's going on there?
Stop fooling around.
Hey!
You low-life thieves.
What officer?
/ Keep quiet.
Low-life thieves?
Damn it.
Hey.
Want some of this?
/No thanks.
Try it.
It's delicious.
No. / Hey, boy.
Pay attention to your elders.
Eat it, buttbrain.
I told you no.
How many times did I tell you?
Am I your toy?
Leave me alone you petty thieves!
Stop toying with me, you jerks!
It's humiliating!
Oh, shit!
Good morning.
Keep quiet!
/Thank you.
Thank you.
You bastard!
Do that again, and you're dead.
What?
Are you free, baby?
Your English is good, too.
Better behave!
Wanna die?
Taste good?
It's so delicious.
You're very happy to see me, aren't you?
Be good to me... and you'll always be with good luck.
If I sleep out, mom beats me with whatever's in her hand.
If she's sweeping, it's a broom stick
If she's cleaning, it's a vacuum.
When I'm lucky, it's a cucumber or eggplant.
So I have to come at the right time.
You studying now?
Yes, I'm.
I'm looking over something on the internet.
Go to bed now. /You too, dad.
All right, good night!
/Good night.
Ok then, I'm gonna have a sleep too.
You're not looking at dirty pictures, right?
Of course not, dad.
You don't trust me?
No, I do.
Time for bed.
Go to sleep. /Good night, dad.
Uh?
Hi, Gyeon-woo.
My birthday's in two days.
You're dead if you forget.
Got it?
Since I like you so much, better make me smile like this. * * |!|!|!|!|!|!|!
Got it?
I got it.
Phew!
Her birthday.
If I prepare nothing, she may murder me.
I have a good idea.
Before going to the service, I worked in a theme park.
So this is my plan.
At midnight, I'll be alone with her in the park.
It'll be completely dark all around us.
One by one, the lights to the merry-go-round flick on.
I raise my arms up there, and her birthday song starts.
Then all the lights turn on and it moves.
There's fireworks, too.
Isn't it fantastic?
She'll be thrilled.
I gave 200,000 won to my friends working there.
Jump over here?
/Yeah.
We have to.
I always wanted to come here at night.
It's my birthday, not yours.
Please, let's just try.
I'll go up first and help you.
Eh?
There's a step here.
Take my hand.
Oh, shit!
Shit!
Gyeon-woo.
Hey!
Answer me.
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
Answer me!
Gyeon-woo!
You're dead.
Wait till I catch you.
Why didn't you answer?
Wanna die?
Come with me!
Hurry and get in.
Shut up!
Go in fast.
Move it.
Sit here.
If you're loud, I'll kill you.
Got it?
Yes.
Answer quietly!
/ Yes.
Is that a real gun?
Wanna see?
/ Forget it.
How are you two related?
We're just friends.
Really?
You mean she could be my pussy?
What?
Your pussy?
I'm not a cat or anything!
Go ahead and apolize!
Alright.
I'll do it.
I'm sorry.
Anyway, friends come here late at night?
Why are you here?
We just wanted to come here at night.
Tell me the truth, idiot. / Nothing special.
Bullshit.
What makes you trust a guy like him?
I trusted myself.
I had a girlfriend, too.
She visited me every week for one year.
I was so happy.
But that bitch fell in love with the guard house sergeant.
I found out the fact after he was discharged.
Damn it.
While I'm in the service, even my dog... ran away with some mutt, too.
My Yorkshire terrier.
Bitch.
Fuck.
I came out to kill both bitches.
Fuck.
I have the worst luck in this world.
Damn it.
Know what special day is it today?
Huh, damn it?
This sucks!
Hey, what are the odds to meet a runaway soldier in a park?
Don't know.
Heard your head blows up if you shoot in the mouth.
Yeah, the hole in your head is this big.
That's serious.
A teeny bullet does that?
Yeah, the bullet tears the...
Hey!
What are you two doing?
Stop joking around.
Damn it.
Damn it!
Even you bastards ignore me.
That's why don't be foolish. /Why am I foolish?
Even if you do this, she won't come back.
I know. I know, too.
But if I die, she'll be heartbroken.
She'll never be the same.
You're wrong.
The pain goes away sooner than you think.
You went through something like this?
Yeah.
It happens that way.
Damn it.
If I'm caught, I'll go to the can.
I'll always think of her there.
What does 'can' mean?
It means prison.
Don't interrupt. /Sorry.
Anyway, you're responsible for your actions now.
Excuse me, sir.
How about letting her go?
If I say no?
Then let me go, instead.
Come to think of it, your eyebrows remind me of that sergeant.
You act like him, too.
You can go.
And you...
We die together.
Got it?
Pardon?
Hey, lady.
Forget about this bastard, and look for a nice guy.
Got it?
Go!
/ Let's go together.
All three of us.
Will you leave if I kill him?
Gyeon-woo.
Don't worry too much.
This soldier isn't a bad guy.
You'll come out safely.
You're leaving me alone?
There's no other way.
I was afraid to die alone, but I'm glad we're in it together.
Oh, right.
Over there, there's an exit near the merry-go-round.
Nobody knows about it.
I used to work here.
Really?
You're not tricking me, right?
I'm a man, too.
Why would I?
Walk in front of me.
See?
I told you so.
This way!
Shit!
What's going on?
It's Gyeon-woo.
Screw you!
Don't come closer!
I'll kill him!
I'll really kill him!
Tell that bitch to come!
So she can see me die!
I'll give you an hour!
If not, I'll kill him, and myself, too!
Got it?
/Hurry up!
Sniper 2!
The hostage is in danger, but we can still fire.
Don't!
Wait!
Don't shoot!
Hey, soldier!
I mean sir!
Your girlfriend changed her mind, right?
Did you really love her?
Ask yourself.
I think you didn't.
If you really love her, you should let her go.
If not, then it's not love.
What's wrong with someone you don't love getting married?
Stop this, and go back to base as a real man.
A person like you should learn more about love.
If we want to learn, then we should keep living.
Damn it.
She's the nicest girl I've met.
Hey!
Don't let her go.
Got it?
If you do, I'll take her.
Can I go?
/Go.
Screw it.
Shit!
Don't know.
Thank you.
Today's my birthday.
I'll live on until I learn what love is.
What?
We're just friends?
No, I said that to save you.
Let me go, instead?
Wanted to save yourself, huh?
He wouldn't have let you go.
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Have a nice life alone.
I screwed up her birthday, but I feel good anyway.
'Cause I'm proud to be with her, and things turned out as planned.
I hope you believe in me.
You can't?
Wait...
Second Half
I remember.
She always came with him until last year.
Was it last spring or winter?
One day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.
To not let anyone sit in his seat that day.
What's up?
Oh, hi.
You're early.
I was in the neighborhood.
Miss me?
Of course!
She always tried hard to look cheery.
I like her that way. /What would you like?
Coke, please.
Wanna die?
Drink coffee.
Two coffees, please.
He he he
I know her.
She pretends to be happy, but she's full of sorrow inside.
What are you doing?
What are you smiling at?
No.
It's nothing.
Looks fun, huh?
Another one?
/Why?
Don't wanna read it?
She may get disappointed, but I should be honest for her sake.
Looks fun.
I'll read it.
This time it's a martial arts film.
The heroine is a bounty hunter.
The villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.
The worst of his kind.
What happened?
His name's Gyeon-woo?
Gyeon-woo?
The story's setting is a mess.
Japan invades during King Sejong's reign, and the king's father is the tyrant Yeonsan.
In the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.
Heavy rain pours down on a sunny day.
Yup~!
The heroine becomes a king.
King Jung-jo.
She's from the future, of course.
It's fun, huh?
Why is the heroine always from the future?
Science is advanced then, so they invent a time machine.
And people go to the past to travel.
People from the future could be here now.
I think UFOs are time machines.
Someday, I'll meet someone from the future.
I have to.
If you do, ask him to take you.
What?
If it's possible...
Give this to Shin Cine.
Tell them to cast Han Suk-gyu and Shim Eun-ha.
Jeon Do-yun is okay, too.
Excuse me, we talked on the phone, right?
Well... this is 'The Warrior's Sad Love Story'...
It's going to be a hit.
Shin Cine didn't call back.
Hey!
Hey, kid.
Is the subway your sketch book?
Don't scribble on it.
Wanna die?
My lipstick!
I always take her home, even to Bupyung station.
It's something a man must do.
On the way, we play fun games, too.
Left foot over the line, I win.
With the right foot, you win.
What's the prize?
Let's see...
How about a kiss?
A kiss?
Wanna die?
You choose.
Hitting each other.
Again?
You can hit me, too.
Okay.
Someone's coming.
I think this is unfair.
I'm a girl, so I'II slap the cheek.
No.
Then I'II change it, too.
But I'm a girl. /Men and women are equal.
Okay, then.
You slap, and I slap, too.
Go easy on me, and I'II kill you.
Better slap me on the cheek.
If you don't, I'II kill you!
AII right.
You slap, and I'II use my finger.
Right, that's fair.
Saw that?
See that guy step over with his left foot?
I had my eyes closed.
plus he came the opposite way.
I thought it was this way.
Shut up.
Here they come.
Left foot.
Left foot.
It'II be the right foot.
Left!
Left!
Switch to the right.
You have to hit me?
You know why the sky is blue?
'Cause the reflection of the sunshine.
Nope.
It's for me!
I want it to be blue.
So, it's blue.
You know why the fire is hot?
It's all for me.
I want it to be hot.
So it is.
You know why we have four seasons here in Korea.
Because of you. /That's correct!
And why you were born here?
It's for me as well. /What?
That's nonsense.
I was born before you.
You know the word of 'worship'?
'Peter came first in order to prepare for the birth of Jesus.' huh?
Well...
Yeah, I know.
So, get ready!
Come here.
Stay still.
When I'm with her,
I never know how the day will turn out.
What?
What are you looking at?
I quit!
Is your face a racket?
Why does the ball always hit my face?
It's strange.
I never want to lose a game.
So I play until I win.
Wait long?
Just a teeny bit.
My mom bought me these heels, but they're killing my feet.
Want a massage?
No, it's okay.
Instead, Iet's exchange shoes.
Don't wanna?
How can a guy wear heels?
It'II fit.
But, I can't...
Yeah?
I see.
Come on.
I'II buy you some sneakers.
Forget it.
Then wear mine, and I'II carry yours.
You don't understand women.
Okay!
Let's exchange.
really?
Wanna know a secret?
What is it?
I don't wear panties on exam day.
But I had one today.
Catch me, honey!
Hey.
If you don't, I'II kill you.
Phew~ /Catch me, honey~!
Stop right there!
Stop!
Out!
It was just a second, but I felt something in her eyes.
That's my house.
Wait.
I'II bring you an umbrella.
I'm okay.
I'm already wet so I'II just leave.
Eh?
Gee~
Are you my daughter's boyfriend?
Yes, sir.
How much do you know about my daughter?
Not much...
Next time, don't hang out till late.
You don't understand me.
Why'd you stand him up?
What's wrong with him?
Why do you stand guys up?
And what happened to your heels?
What's wrong with you?
I told you not to meet Gyeon-woo.
He's dumb and has no future.
It's none of your business.
Why is he stupid?
You're stupid so you don't know.
What has gotten in to you?
Let me live my own life!
Afterwards,
I didn't hear from her for a Iong time.
hello?
/ Gyeon-woo, it's me.
Long time no see.
Her voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.
Our 100th day celebration is soon.
It's 100 days already?
When do you think a girl's the prettiest?
When a sexy woman is naked.
Where are you now?
Stay right there.
No, I'm just kidding.
The prettiest is when she's playing the piano.
What's your favorite song?
That George Winston song.
PacheIbeI Canon?
Yeah, that song.
You're not gonna ask me?
When is the guy the prettiest?
Just give me a rose.
still have your high school uniform?
Yeah.
Why?
Bring it on our 100th day, and give me a rose during my class.
Do it yourself, okay?
What?
What did you say?
How can I during class?
Hey!
Just hung up on me!
Damn it!
I don't wanna get beaten by her, or get humiliated at a women's college.
Oh my God!
A burglar!
help, a burglar!
Eh?
Are you crazy?
You're gonna break into where?
What on earth are you doing in broad daylight?
And you...
Why you didn't drop by an aunt's coming and going Bupyung for the girl.
You never know how much hard time I went through for you.
She even intends to introduce a girl to you.
Gyeon-woo!
Where are you going?
I'm cleverer than I Iook.
These girls sure love Chinese food.
Hey, you!
Where you headed?
Come here!
I'm delivering Chinese food.
I ordered it.
Bring it here.
really?
Bring a Iot of radish?
Oh, I forgot something!
Give me the food first!
That's the wrong way!
There's another customer.
Hey!
But that wasn't enough for her.
We relived our old high school days.
Drink!
Drink till die!
I've never had anything like this.
Gee!
Sorry, I'm gonna drink it in my way.
feeling so good!
Have a smoke, too!
Wow, I've never had a smoke, either!
Gonna be a big deal.
I don't smoke well...
What are we supposed to do if caught by teacher.
It's a suspension!
You've already had your ups and downs in life.
Not to worry.
Go ahead and smoke!
Hey, you are such a tough cookie!
You go to a very good school!
These clothes are so tight!
After we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.
But she got wasted again.
Oh, wild teens!
Here's a condom.
Let's prevent AIDS.
Taxi!
She's having a happy dream.
Compared to when I looked at her in the motel the first time,
She looks so different.
Could her pain be cured now?
Maybe it means that she doesn't need me anymore.
Excuse me.
Can you drive slowly?
Here.
Have any plans after graduation?
Actually, I've never thought about it yet.
Can I see what's in your pocket?
Sir?
Right.
It's a condom.
What is this for?
Oh, right.
I learned that it prevents AIDS.
But I haven't used it yet.
Actually, on the way here. / Forget it.
'Chicks Hen'?
What does this mean?
Oh, right.
It's a chicken soup restaurant.
'We'll satisfy all your wishes?
'
I think it's to satisfy our tastes.
'Hurry and tell him.'
How do feel about our daughter?
Oh, right.
We're just friends now.
Please don't worry.
If we get closer, I'll let you know, sir.
Don't see her any more.
After that day, she never calls me.
It was sudden, but that's how we broke up.
We've broken up.
Now, I'm free.
It's me.
Come to the cafe by seven o'clock.
Why?
What?
I have a blind date today.
Come in 45 minutes.
I have a blind date, too.
Are you on your way?
I'm on a date with a girl.
Hurry up.
I have to go to the bathroom.
'Gotta go to the bathroom.'
Eh?
Nice to meet you.
I'm Cha Seok-won.
Nice to meet you.
Same here. / Have a seat.
Were you really with a girl?
No, I was with a guy.
Can I take your order?
Coffee, please.
You can drink coke.
I'll drink coffee.
Gyeon-woo.
You're very lucky.
I heard a lot about you.
That you're a close friend.
Friend...
I need to go to the bathroom.
How is he?
No idea... but he looks nice.
He is not the man you broke up with, is he?
How do you know?
When you see a new man...
Forget about the past, all right?
How the hell do you know?
This necklace is given from your ex-boyfriend, isn't it?
You wouldn't wear it if you just broke up for nothing.
Considering your temper... and you... used to say that you couldn't get over him.
Does that means he isn't here anymore in this world.
That man is the one my mom introduced to me.
She kept pushing me to meet him Doesn't look bad, does he?
Yes.
Hey, listen!
I'm totally ok, but you should be obedient to man.
Man likes something more feminine.
And... don't drink a lot.
Some of the guys target intoxicated girls.
And it's all right with me, but to the other guys try to surrender for just once.
... not try to win.
Good luck to you.
Where's Gyeon-woo?
He left already.
He told me ten rules to follow.
I have a good memory.
I'll recite them.
First, don't ask her to be feminine.
And don't...
Second, don't let her drink over three glasses.
She'll beat someone.
At a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.
If she hits you, act like it hurts.
If it hurts, act like it doesn't.
On your 100th day together, give her a rose during her class.
She'll like it a lot.
Make sure you learn fencing and squash.
Also, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.
If she says she'll kill you, don't take it lightly.
You'll feel better.
If her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.
Finally, she likes to write.
Encourage her.
Ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention...
Gyeon-woo.
Step back behind the yellow line...
Gyeon-woo!
after passengers getting off, take in order...
Gyeon-woo!
please use the next train.
What's his name?
Gyeon-woo.
I'll do it myself.
Gyeon-woo.
Where are you?
I looked all over for you.
Gyeon-woo.
Come to the escalator.
Okay?
You're dead if you don't.
Hurry up.
Who told you to hug me?
Dummy.
You're supposed to dodge.
Sometimes I feel like I know her and sometimes I don't.
We're definitely standing at the crossroad now.
What's going on between us?
Can this relationship last forever?
Who is it?
It's me, Dad.
She told me to write a letter and bring it.
To write it on paper.
To express my feelings,
I tried hard to find the right words.
When I first met her,
I wanted to cure her grief, but now I can't give her up.
I wish we can get serious.
I'm writing about these feelings.
She's probably writing about me now.
This is how we're preparing to split up.
Gyeon-woo.
See that mountain top?
Yeah.
Could someone hear me from there?
Yes, probably so.
Or probably not.
Then go over there.
I'll shout here.
If you hear, answer me.
You want me to go over there?
Yeah.
Gyeon-woo?
Can you hear me?
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry.
I really can't help it.
Gyeon-woo.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry...
I can't help it.
I thought I was different, but I'm just a helpless girl.
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry.
Did you bring your letter?
Yeah.
What's that?
A time capsule.
We put our letters in it and bury it here.
And two years later, let's meet here again.
We'll read the letters that day, and maybe we can find an answer then.
This was her way of saying good-bye, and I kept repeating in my mind that two years isn't long.
Let's open this exactly two years later, at two, Okay?
We can meet two years later.
When we meet then, we'll be different from what we are now.
We may become closer, or stay forever apart.
We can only choose one.
Gyeon-woo.
You go first.
Let's separate here.
Should we go together?
No, I'll take the next train.
I think that's better.
See you two years later!
Okay, in two years!
Two years!
Bye!
Gyeon-woo!
That's how we broke up.
Over time
I couldn't endure the loneliness after we broke up.
Thinking of those memories,
I started to write about our stories on the Internet.
Then I made up my mind.
If I meet her again, I'll show her a different me.
Got to make use of my time.
For her and my future's sake.
Why does the ball I hit keep hitting my face?
I wrote our stories on the Internet everyday, and I kept myself busy for two years.
Yu~p!
Excuse me.
I wrote 'My Sassy Girl'.
Shin Cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.
I made her dream come true instead.
I wanted to tell her right away, but I can only wait till that day.
She didn't come.
It's our only day to meet.
No one knows when she will come.
Wow!
How did he get in here?
It's a mystery.
Gyeon-woo!
How are you?
I was so happy while being with you.
I'm not sure if you knew, but the person I loved passed away.
The day when I first met you was the day he died a year ago.
Actually, I tried to look for him in you.
I know it was wrong.
I'm sorry.
I also met him on the subway like you.
I was really sick at that time.
He did everything I wanted.
Like you did to me.
Under this tree, we planned our future together.
But he suddenly passed away.
While I was dating you, I met his mother often.
She wanted to introduce a nice man to me, but I couldn't.
The day I first met you, I came under this tree, and I prayed to him.
To let me free.
When I met you, this occurred to me.
That maybe... he introduced you to me.
But the more I met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.
The more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.
While the two of us are apart,
I want to forget him alone.
After that day, I went often to this place.
If I'm not with you after two years, it means I still lack of courage.
How much will we change after two years?
I feel like you live in the future, and I stay in the past.
I want to meet you soon, so I can read your letter.
Why are you staring at me, sir?
Because you're so pretty.
I thought an angel came down.
Do you come here often?
Sometimes.
This tree has a secret.
I have a secret here, too.
Really?
Three years ago, I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.
What's your secret?
So what happened?
We promised to read the letters a year ago.
But I couldn't come.
I guess you're a year late.
But two years didn't seem that long.
I haven't made any decision yet.
I just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.
Like what?
If we were destined to meet,
I thought we'd meet by chance somewhere.
Know what fate is?
Building a bridge of chance for someone you love.
To be honest, I read you guys letters.
I said this tree had a secret, right?
Yes.
Look closely.
Does this tree look the same as before?
Well, it looks like it changed a bit.
But I'm not sure.
People are dead or alive.
There's a dead tree and a living tree, too.
This tree was struck dead by lightning last year.
It was split into two.
But this young man felt sorry for it.
During this spring, he planted another tree that looked the same.
When he planted the tree, he asked me if it look the same.
He said that someone would be sad if it died, so no one should know.
Gyeon-woo...
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
Hi.
It's been a while.
You've gotten prettier.
You still look young.
How have you been?
You were in England?
Yes.
For one and a half years.
So I can forget him.
I see.
Feel better?
Yes.
A lot better.
Is it true now?
My son might be sad.
He won't.
He'll like it this way.
Good, that's what I really hoped.
Auntie!
I was getting my photo taken.
You naughty boy.
Know how long it's been?
Sorry I didn't tell you before.
This is Gyeon-woo.
Doesn't he resemble him?
When you had a hard time,
I tried to introduce you to him for several years, but he kept getting out of it.
Heard you came to Bupyung often, but you never visited me?
Go out with him.
I thought he'd make things easy for you.
Oh, yeah.
Gyeon-woo, you're going to England, right?
She's already been there, so she can give you some tips.
I don't have to go now.
Why?
You two know each other?
You may not believe it, but I think I met a man from the future.
From your future.
This is how I met her again.
Think it's too coincidental?
It's building a bridge of chance for your love.

MY SASSY GIRL
Exactly two years ago today, she and I buried a time capsule here.
We promised to meet here two years later, but she hasn't come yet.
I'm going to wait.
Here we go.
Please don't move.
One, two...
Wait a minute.
Hello?
Oh, auntie.
Sorry, I'm on my way.
I'm really sorry.
Yes, I'm coming.
I'm having my photo taken.
Bye.
Are you ready?
Here we go.
One, two...
My parents wanted a daughter, so they raised me like one.
So I thought I was a girl until I was seven.
I had to go to the women's public bath, too.
The older I got,
I thought my penis would get smaller and disappear.
But it was the opposite.
First Half
He hasn't changed at all.
No, I'm a real man now.
Hey, asshole.
Think clerical work in the army makes you a man?
You irritate me!
Give me a break, asshole.
My job was tougher than you could imagine.
Hey!
I worked near the DMZ.
Who are you kidding?
Hold it.
Anyway, welcome back home.
She's just my type.
When I see my type, I can't help it.
I need to hit on her.
Who's interrupting me?
Hello?
Who is this?
Your mother, you bastard. /Oh, mom...
Why aren't you at your aunt's house?
I'm leaving soon.
Keep quiet!
It's my mom!
Talk over there!
Make sure you pay a visit.
It's been over a year since you saw her.
That long?
You know she feels lonely after losing her son last year.
She says you resemble him.
She'll be so glad to see you.
Still there?
We don't look alike.
Plus, I hate when she rubs my face and kisses me.
Uncle does, too.
She'll introduce you to a girl.
Hey!
I know the type she likes.
Tell her no thanks.
I want to meet a girl like the ones in romantic comic books.
But on that day...
She's my type, but I don't like her.
Why?
Drunk girls disgust me.
Hey, get up!
Offer your seat to the elderly!
Ugh!
Go!
Hey.
Don't wear pink.
Honey!
She call him honey!
I'm not...
What are you doing!
I'm not...
You handle this!
I'm not...
Think I'm stupid?
Come here!
Are you laughing?
Why didn't you look after her?
Hurry and do something!
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Let me help with cleaning expenses.
Forget it.
Just take care of her.
Nothing's there when you need it.
Where did all those motels go?
I hate being with a drunk girl.
Carrying her on my back is worse.
Wow, your honey's wasted.
No, it's not my fault.
Of course, it is.
I know everything.
You see, we're engaged.
Western or Korean style?
Give me any room.
Room 405.
None on the first floor?
Fourth floor!
You forgot to check in.
It's 40,000 won, kid.
What?
40,000 won?
Why?
Find another place then.
Count it.
624... 770
Shindang-dong, Joong-gu...
Seoul...
Hey, why do you keep reading this?
016... 228... 53...
Oh, please...
A thousand won left!
Hello?
This phone's owner?
She's sleeping beside me.
What?
Here?
The Uk-su motel near Bupyung station.
Better wash and leave fast.
Aha!
Hands in the air!
What are you doing?
Hands in the air!
Aaggh!
No, I'm not, sir!
I told you.
I'm an innocent victim.
Talk about it later and get in there.
Oh, damn!
I'm gonna die mad!
Come over here.
Come on!
Please forgive me just this once.
Please forgive me.
I can't get in there...
How are you?
please, please save my life!
Hi?
How are you?
Please just for once!
Please...
See you!
What's your name?
Answer now!
Boss told you!
Gyeon-woo, I'm Gyeon-woo.
What brought you here?
I'm innocent.
I'm telling the truth, sir!
So you're an innocent and we're fucking guilty, huh?
No, I don't mean that!
That's exactly what you said, Motherfucker!
I'm gonna put it right.
I'm sorry.
You raped a girl, huh?
Nope!
No!
Come on!
Shoot now, you little creep!
You wanna cut your finger or talk now?
Huh?
Be quick, He told you, you little bastard!
You turn against him, or what?
All of you.
Eat one a piece, okay?
Yes, boss.
What are you looking at?
Look away.
Gyeon-woo!
You're out!
Take care you guys!
Bye!
And remember to keep in touch!
Uh...
Oh, yeah.
Don't just pass by us next time, all right?
Of course.
See you.
Hey!
You come over here.
Didn't I say eat one a piece!
I'm home.
Did you go to Bupyung?
Yes, I did.
Come here!
Where did you sleep?
Your aunt said you didn't come!
And you're telling me a lie!
What happened to your sweater?
I'm such a poor guy.
All this because of a drunk girl.
I wanna die.
You asked if I went to Bupyung!
I did, but not to see auntie!
What?
Bastard!
Wait till he comes back.
Know me now, right?
I'm a typical student.
An engineering major.
Study?
I'm smart, but I never study.
My parents can prove that.
You're smart like me, but studying is your problem.
Since you inherited your brain from me, you'll get good grades if you study harder, idiot.
Up four points in three years.
Call this a report card?
Since you inherited your brain from your mom, you'll get good grades if you study harder.
If you raise kids, never tell them they're smart.
They'll never study.
My goals?
Haven't thought about it yet.
You know now?
You got it.
I'm a hopeless student.
Hello?
Who are you, asshole?
What?
Who's calling?
Why were you naked in a motel with me?
What?
Come out!
To Bupyung station now!
Uh...
How could she do this?
I went to jail and got beaten with a vacuum for her.
Excuse me.
Is it you?
Yes?
Follow me.
Get over here.
What do you wanna eat?
Cherry jubilee...
Mango Tango or Shooting Stars...
Jamonka Almonds good, too.
I'll just have a Love Me.
Hey, wanna die?
Drink coffee.
Two coffees.
You pay for it.
Tell me.
What happened last night?
Well, it's...
You were drunk, so...
Don't stumble, and speak clearly!
You see.
You were drunk and staggering at the subway station.
I saved you from the train.
I thought maybe this girl was a snake.
Pretending to be drunk and vomiting to use the guy in a state of confusion.
So I called you honey?
That's right.
I kind of remember that.
You showered to wash off vomit and sweat, and the police came?
That's right.
Would you believe that, too?
To a girl like this, you need to show her who's the boss.
So I did that, right?
Yes, you did.
Sorry, it's late. /Yeah...
When she's not drunk, she's just my type.
You look prettier and livelier than yesterday.
Are you mocking me?
No, I'm not.
Then are you hitting on me?
I don't wanna date you.
We're not destined for each other.
Throw the trash away.
Damn it.
I think she's a heavy drinker.
You order.
Kimchi soup and Soju, please.
Eat Golbangee.
Then you should order.
Stop pouting!
Golbangee, please.
Let's go somewhere fun later.
I know what that means.
A motel?
Are you rich?
/ Of course.
How much will you give us?
We'll see, so don't worry.
You kids are prostituting, huh?
Why'd you order Golbangee?
Eat something else!
What's it to you?
Mind your own business.
We're just having a drink with some friends.
What's wrong?
You take friends to a motel?
How old are you kids?
Old enough to drink.
Mind your own business.
Think I'm doing this 'cause you're drinking?
Show me your ID.
You, too.
What's with you?
Show it, now.
This sucks.
She's a vicious chick.
No matter how pretty she is,
I'm too embarrassed to be with her.
Who are you to butt in other people's business?
Don't you have a daughter?
/ I don't.
Bear me one.
Who the hell do you think you are?
How dare you?
/Come on, let's fight!
Come on!
I'll show you.
Don't live like that!
Catch up with the girls.
Have a drink and calm down.
Shit!
Ah!
Seeing a girl cry makes me sad for some reason.
She's more attractive the closer I look at her.
Did you blow your nose on this?
No.
Please stop crying.
Also...
The handkerchief is mine.
To be honest,
I broke up with my boyfriend yesterday.
Excuse me.
Wake up.
Come on, wake up.
Your fiances wasted again?
What now?
Sign you in like before, right?
Yes.
But mister, have any medicine for alcohol?
No, you buy it.
Where did you go, honey?
What!
What is it?
/ Uh!
I saw her lips.
Her white neck.
And...
I saw her breast, too.
While watching her sleep like a baby, it may be forward, but this occurred to me.
I want to heal her sorrow.
Give me some water.
Hey.
Why am I here?
You see.
I'm sorry, but I saw your ID, and you're twenty-four.
If you talk down on me again...
So what are you gonna do?
Just that...
Nothing.
Give me the towel.
Yes.
You see, I'm a year older.
Then talk like friends. /Yeah?
Toothbrush.
Toothpaste?
In the bathroom.
Our relationship is so peculiar.
We met only three days ago, and slept twice in a motel.
That's how our relationship began.
Lee Hyung-chuI.
Here.
Jeun Mi-young.
Here.
Kang Man-gyu.
Yep.
Gyeon-woo.
Is he absent?
No, no!
I'm here!
Then answer right away.
Phew!
Gonna be sucks!
Lee Jeung-min.
Here.
Gu SeoI-soo.
(In a dialect) Yes, I'm here.
Professor.
How about a break?
You're right.
Let's take a break.
Let's go.
Go where?
Class isn't over yet.
Don't be a coward.
He called roll, right?
Let's go.
I can't.
I can't miss this class.
Kill me instead.
All right.
Who is she?
She's pretty.
Pretty?
Doesn't matter.
A girl needs to act pretty.
But she's still pretty. / Nice body, too.
Who's Gyeon-woo?
It's me, sir.
I won't mark you absent so you can leave.
Pardon me?
I said leave.
Why?
Wasn't that girl your girlfriend?
So go see her.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, Gyeon-woo.
If you can, raise it with her.
It worked.
What did you tell him?
That I'm getting an abortion, and you're the father.
What?
No, no!
Professor, it's not true!
She wanted to be a scriptwriter, so she kept writing stories.
She called them synopsis.
To get me into the mood, she took me to the park to read them.
Reading her synopsis was stressful.
If I miss anything, I'm dead.
Wanna die?
Finish reading it.
I will.
Mister!
How could you throw the butt here?
Pick it up!
And why did you wear that color?
Then what about you?
Don't wear the same color as mine!
The heroine is tough, like the 'Terminator'.
The year is 2137.
Villains kidnap her lover and travels to the present.
I don't know why.
To save her lover, she travels in a time machine to the present.
They have to kiss in the end.
This isn't a melodrama.
It's an action movie.
You don't know movies.
Koreans like melodramas.
Why?
Know what novel touched us when we were teenagers?
Shower by Hwang Sun-won.
It shaped our people's sensibility in their teens.
Koreans like sad movies all because of 'Shower'.
Shower?
What's sad about it?
It's sad when she asked to be buried in the clothes reminiscent of her love.
I couldn't sleep for one week.
The ending sucks.
Gotta change it.
How?
It's sad.
Her family couldn't afford to pay for her medicine.
Their family line is broken up now.
But you know, she must have been an extraordinary girl.
Gyeon-woo's mother:
Why?
This was her last request.
When I die, please bury me with my loving friend.
Gyeon-woo's mother:
What?
To bury him alive, even.
Oh, my gosh.
What's the matter?
/ What's wrong?
No way!
This is wrong!
This is wrong!
This is wrong!
Please.
Don't!
Bury him!
They bury him alive.
Isn't it sad?
I must be hurt still.
I think I'll never get over him.
How deep could it be?
I don't know.
Gyeon-woo, go in the water.
I wanna know how deep it is.
Come on.
Help me!
Help me!
Wow, it's deep.
I can't swim!
Yes, it's deep...
My mind was getting blurry.
At that moment...
Heard you got a girlfriend.
Introduce me.
Really?
/ I'm serious.
Is she pretty?
Have you kissed her?
Girlfriend?
Gonna introduce me or not?
She really pretty?
What are you looking at?
See that girl over there?
She's my girlfriend from today.
Got it?
Hey...
Excuse me...
Hey, baby.
Are you free?
/ Hey?
What?
Baby?
Hey!
Come here.
Hmm!
How could a coincidence like this happen?
Reportedly say there is an accident of runaway soldier...
Hello?
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
Let's drink.
Drink till we die.
1 hours ago It's me.
Where are you?
What are you doing?
Meeting your friends?
Can't I join us, can I?
Why not?
I wanna see your friends!
Hey!
Hey!
Now, you're dead.
Excuse me...
You've just forgotten your things.
Oh my gosh!
It's kind of you, thanks.
Do you want me to hold it for you?
Oh no.
That's all right. /All right then.
I'll help you, ma'am.
Oh, thank you. /No problem.
Watch your step!
Hey, money!
Ooh!
Damn it!
Since I'm drunk,
I decided to take revenge on her.
If I'm out cold at Bupyung station, then she'll have to carry me on her back.
This stop is Bupyung station...
Hey, kid.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Where am I?
I'm at Inchon station.
Be here in 30 minutes.
Wake up.
Get up, idiot.
Go away, buttbrain.
Talking back?
Get up, bastard!
/ What the...
How're you?
Hi!
How are you?
Oh, how is it going?
What?
Go away, buttbrain?
You got a bad mouth.
I'll set you straight the gangster's way.
On your head.
Get up.
Sit down.
Get up.
Sit down.
Roll right.
Roll left.
Do it right.
Keep going!
What's going on there?
Stop fooling around.
Hey!
You low-life thieves.
What officer?
/ Keep quiet.
Low-life thieves?
Damn it.
Hey.
Want some of this?
/No thanks.
Try it.
It's delicious.
No. / Hey, boy.
Pay attention to your elders.
Eat it, buttbrain.
I told you no.
How many times did I tell you?
Am I your toy?
Leave me alone you petty thieves!
Stop toying with me, you jerks!
It's humiliating!
Oh, shit!
Good morning.
Keep quiet!
/Thank you.
Thank you.
You bastard!
Do that again, and you're dead.
What?
Are you free, baby?
Your English is good, too.
Better behave!
Wanna die?
Taste good?
It's so delicious.
You're very happy to see me, aren't you?
Be good to me... and you'll always be with good luck.
If I sleep out, mom beats me with whatever's in her hand.
If she's sweeping, it's a broom stick
If she's cleaning, it's a vacuum.
When I'm lucky, it's a cucumber or eggplant.
So I have to come at the right time.
You studying now?
Yes, I'm.
I'm looking over something on the internet.
Go to bed now. /You too, dad.
All right, good night!
/Good night.
Ok then, I'm gonna have a sleep too.
You're not looking at dirty pictures, right?
Of course not, dad.
You don't trust me?
No, I do.
Time for bed.
Go to sleep. /Good night, dad.
Uh?
Hi, Gyeon-woo.
My birthday's in two days.
You're dead if you forget.
Got it?
Since I like you so much, better make me smile like this. * * |!|!|!|!|!|!|!
Got it?
I got it.
Phew!
Her birthday.
If I prepare nothing, she may murder me.
I have a good idea.
Before going to the service, I worked in a theme park.
So this is my plan.
At midnight, I'll be alone with her in the park.
It'll be completely dark all around us.
One by one, the lights to the merry-go-round flick on.
I raise my arms up there, and her birthday song starts.
Then all the lights turn on and it moves.
There's fireworks, too.
Isn't it fantastic?
She'll be thrilled.
I gave 200,000 won to my friends working there.
Jump over here?
/Yeah.
We have to.
I always wanted to come here at night.
It's my birthday, not yours.
Please, let's just try.
I'll go up first and help you.
Eh?
There's a step here.
Take my hand.
Oh, shit!
Shit!
Gyeon-woo.
Hey!
Answer me.
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
Answer me!
Gyeon-woo!
You're dead.
Wait till I catch you.
Why didn't you answer?
Wanna die?
Come with me!
Hurry and get in.
Shut up!
Go in fast.
Move it.
Sit here.
If you're loud, I'll kill you.
Got it?
Yes.
Answer quietly!
/ Yes.
Is that a real gun?
Wanna see?
/ Forget it.
How are you two related?
We're just friends.
Really?
You mean she could be my pussy?
What?
Your pussy?
I'm not a cat or anything!
Go ahead and apolize!
Alright.
I'll do it.
I'm sorry.
Anyway, friends come here late at night?
Why are you here?
We just wanted to come here at night.
Tell me the truth, idiot. / Nothing special.
Bullshit.
What makes you trust a guy like him?
I trusted myself.
I had a girlfriend, too.
She visited me every week for one year.
I was so happy.
But that bitch fell in love with the guard house sergeant.
I found out the fact after he was discharged.
Damn it.
While I'm in the service, even my dog... ran away with some mutt, too.
My Yorkshire terrier.
Bitch.
Fuck.
I came out to kill both bitches.
Fuck.
I have the worst luck in this world.
Damn it.
Know what special day is it today?
Huh, damn it?
This sucks!
Hey, what are the odds to meet a runaway soldier in a park?
Don't know.
Heard your head blows up if you shoot in the mouth.
Yeah, the hole in your head is this big.
That's serious.
A teeny bullet does that?
Yeah, the bullet tears the...
Hey!
What are you two doing?
Stop joking around.
Damn it.
Damn it!
Even you bastards ignore me.
That's why don't be foolish. /Why am I foolish?
Even if you do this, she won't come back.
I know. I know, too.
But if I die, she'll be heartbroken.
She'll never be the same.
You're wrong.
The pain goes away sooner than you think.
You went through something like this?
Yeah.
It happens that way.
Damn it.
If I'm caught, I'll go to the can.
I'll always think of her there.
What does 'can' mean?
It means prison.
Don't interrupt. /Sorry.
Anyway, you're responsible for your actions now.
Excuse me, sir.
How about letting her go?
If I say no?
Then let me go, instead.
Come to think of it, your eyebrows remind me of that sergeant.
You act like him, too.
You can go.
And you...
We die together.
Got it?
Pardon?
Hey, lady.
Forget about this bastard, and look for a nice guy.
Got it?
Go!
/ Let's go together.
All three of us.
Will you leave if I kill him?
Gyeon-woo.
Don't worry too much.
This soldier isn't a bad guy.
You'll come out safely.
You're leaving me alone?
There's no other way.
I was afraid to die alone, but I'm glad we're in it together.
Oh, right.
Over there, there's an exit near the merry-go-round.
Nobody knows about it.
I used to work here.
Really?
You're not tricking me, right?
I'm a man, too.
Why would I?
Walk in front of me.
See?
I told you so.
This way!
Shit!
What's going on?
It's Gyeon-woo.
Screw you!
Don't come closer!
I'll kill him!
I'll really kill him!
Tell that bitch to come!
So she can see me die!
I'll give you an hour!
If not, I'll kill him, and myself, too!
Got it?
/Hurry up!
Sniper 2!
The hostage is in danger, but we can still fire.
Don't!
Wait!
Don't shoot!
Hey, soldier!
I mean sir!
Your girlfriend changed her mind, right?
Did you really love her?
Ask yourself.
I think you didn't.
If you really love her, you should let her go.
If not, then it's not love.
What's wrong with someone you don't love getting married?
Stop this, and go back to base as a real man.
A person like you should learn more about love.
If we want to learn, then we should keep living.
Damn it.
She's the nicest girl I've met.
Hey!
Don't let her go.
Got it?
If you do, I'll take her.
Can I go?
/Go.
Screw it.
Shit!
Don't know.
Thank you.
Today's my birthday.
I'll live on until I learn what love is.
What?
We're just friends?
No, I said that to save you.
Let me go, instead?
Wanted to save yourself, huh?
He wouldn't have let you go.
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Have a nice life alone.
I screwed up her birthday, but I feel good anyway.
'Cause I'm proud to be with her, and things turned out as planned.
I hope you believe in me.
You can't?
Wait...
Second Half
I remember.
She always came with him until last year.
Was it last spring or winter?
One day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.
To not let anyone sit in his seat that day.
What's up?
Oh, hi.
You're early.
I was in the neighborhood.
Miss me?
Of course!
She always tried hard to look cheery.
I like her that way. /What would you like?
Coke, please.
Wanna die?
Drink coffee.
Two coffees, please.
He he he
I know her.
She pretends to be happy, but she's full of sorrow inside.
What are you doing?
What are you smiling at?
No.
It's nothing.
Looks fun, huh?
Another one?
/Why?
Don't wanna read it?
She may get disappointed, but I should be honest for her sake.
Looks fun.
I'll read it.
This time it's a martial arts film.
The heroine is a bounty hunter.
The villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.
The worst of his kind.
What happened?
His name's Gyeon-woo?
Gyeon-woo?
The story's setting is a mess.
Japan invades during King Sejong's reign, and the king's father is the tyrant Yeonsan.
In the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.
Heavy rain pours down on a sunny day.
Yup~!
The heroine becomes a king.
King Jung-jo.
She's from the future, of course.
It's fun, huh?
Why is the heroine always from the future?
Science is advanced then, so they invent a time machine.
And people go to the past to travel.
People from the future could be here now.
I think UFOs are time machines.
Someday, I'll meet someone from the future.
I have to.
If you do, ask him to take you.
What?
If it's possible...
Give this to Shin Cine.
Tell them to cast Han Suk-gyu and Shim Eun-ha.
Jeon Do-yun is okay, too.
Excuse me, we talked on the phone, right?
Well... this is 'The Warrior's Sad Love Story'...
It's going to be a hit.
Shin Cine didn't call back.
Hey!
Hey, kid.
Is the subway your sketch book?
Don't scribble on it.
Wanna die?
My lipstick!
I always take her home, even to Bupyung station.
It's something a man must do.
On the way, we play fun games, too.
Left foot over the line, I win.
With the right foot, you win.
What's the prize?
Let's see...
How about a kiss?
A kiss?
Wanna die?
You choose.
Hitting each other.
Again?
You can hit me, too.
Okay.
Someone's coming.
I think this is unfair.
I'm a girl, so I'II slap the cheek.
No.
Then I'II change it, too.
But I'm a girl. /Men and women are equal.
Okay, then.
You slap, and I slap, too.
Go easy on me, and I'II kill you.
Better slap me on the cheek.
If you don't, I'II kill you!
AII right.
You slap, and I'II use my finger.
Right, that's fair.
Saw that?
See that guy step over with his left foot?
I had my eyes closed.
plus he came the opposite way.
I thought it was this way.
Shut up.
Here they come.
Left foot.
Left foot.
It'II be the right foot.
Left!
Left!
Switch to the right.
You have to hit me?
You know why the sky is blue?
'Cause the reflection of the sunshine.
Nope.
It's for me!
I want it to be blue.
So, it's blue.
You know why the fire is hot?
It's all for me.
I want it to be hot.
So it is.
You know why we have four seasons here in Korea.
Because of you. /That's correct!
And why you were born here?
It's for me as well. /What?
That's nonsense.
I was born before you.
You know the word of 'worship'?
'Peter came first in order to prepare for the birth of Jesus.' huh?
Well...
Yeah, I know.
So, get ready!
Come here.
Stay still.
When I'm with her,
I never know how the day will turn out.
What?
What are you looking at?
I quit!
Is your face a racket?
Why does the ball always hit my face?
It's strange.
I never want to lose a game.
So I play until I win.
Wait long?
Just a teeny bit.
My mom bought me these heels, but they're killing my feet.
Want a massage?
No, it's okay.
Instead, Iet's exchange shoes.
Don't wanna?
How can a guy wear heels?
It'II fit.
But, I can't...
Yeah?
I see.
Come on.
I'II buy you some sneakers.
Forget it.
Then wear mine, and I'II carry yours.
You don't understand women.
Okay!
Let's exchange.
really?
Wanna know a secret?
What is it?
I don't wear panties on exam day.
But I had one today.
Catch me, honey!
Hey.
If you don't, I'II kill you.
Phew~ /Catch me, honey~!
Stop right there!
Stop!
Out!
It was just a second, but I felt something in her eyes.
That's my house.
Wait.
I'II bring you an umbrella.
I'm okay.
I'm already wet so I'II just leave.
Eh?
Gee~
Are you my daughter's boyfriend?
Yes, sir.
How much do you know about my daughter?
Not much...
Next time, don't hang out till late.
You don't understand me.
Why'd you stand him up?
What's wrong with him?
Why do you stand guys up?
And what happened to your heels?
What's wrong with you?
I told you not to meet Gyeon-woo.
He's dumb and has no future.
It's none of your business.
Why is he stupid?
You're stupid so you don't know.
What has gotten in to you?
Let me live my own life!
Afterwards,
I didn't hear from her for a Iong time.
hello?
/ Gyeon-woo, it's me.
Long time no see.
Her voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.
Our 100th day celebration is soon.
It's 100 days already?
When do you think a girl's the prettiest?
When a sexy woman is naked.
Where are you now?
Stay right there.
No, I'm just kidding.
The prettiest is when she's playing the piano.
What's your favorite song?
That George Winston song.
PacheIbeI Canon?
Yeah, that song.
You're not gonna ask me?
When is the guy the prettiest?
Just give me a rose.
still have your high school uniform?
Yeah.
Why?
Bring it on our 100th day, and give me a rose during my class.
Do it yourself, okay?
What?
What did you say?
How can I during class?
Hey!
Just hung up on me!
Damn it!
I don't wanna get beaten by her, or get humiliated at a women's college.
Oh my God!
A burglar!
help, a burglar!
Eh?
Are you crazy?
You're gonna break into where?
What on earth are you doing in broad daylight?
And you...
Why you didn't drop by an aunt's coming and going Bupyung for the girl.
You never know how much hard time I went through for you.
She even intends to introduce a girl to you.
Gyeon-woo!
Where are you going?
I'm cleverer than I Iook.
These girls sure love Chinese food.
Hey, you!
Where you headed?
Come here!
I'm delivering Chinese food.
I ordered it.
Bring it here.
really?
Bring a Iot of radish?
Oh, I forgot something!
Give me the food first!
That's the wrong way!
There's another customer.
Hey!
But that wasn't enough for her.
We relived our old high school days.
Drink!
Drink till die!
I've never had anything like this.
Gee!
Sorry, I'm gonna drink it in my way.
feeling so good!
Have a smoke, too!
Wow, I've never had a smoke, either!
Gonna be a big deal.
I don't smoke well...
What are we supposed to do if caught by teacher.
It's a suspension!
You've already had your ups and downs in life.
Not to worry.
Go ahead and smoke!
Hey, you are such a tough cookie!
You go to a very good school!
These clothes are so tight!
After we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.
But she got wasted again.
Oh, wild teens!
Here's a condom.
Let's prevent AIDS.
Taxi!
She's having a happy dream.
Compared to when I looked at her in the motel the first time,
She looks so different.
Could her pain be cured now?
Maybe it means that she doesn't need me anymore.
Excuse me.
Can you drive slowly?
Here.
Have any plans after graduation?
Actually, I've never thought about it yet.
Can I see what's in your pocket?
Sir?
Right.
It's a condom.
What is this for?
Oh, right.
I learned that it prevents AIDS.
But I haven't used it yet.
Actually, on the way here. / Forget it.
'Chicks Hen'?
What does this mean?
Oh, right.
It's a chicken soup restaurant.
'We'll satisfy all your wishes?
'
I think it's to satisfy our tastes.
'Hurry and tell him.'
How do feel about our daughter?
Oh, right.
We're just friends now.
Please don't worry.
If we get closer, I'll let you know, sir.
Don't see her any more.
After that day, she never calls me.
It was sudden, but that's how we broke up.
We've broken up.
Now, I'm free.
It's me.
Come to the cafe by seven o'clock.
Why?
What?
I have a blind date today.
Come in 45 minutes.
I have a blind date, too.
Are you on your way?
I'm on a date with a girl.
Hurry up.
I have to go to the bathroom.
'Gotta go to the bathroom.'
Eh?
Nice to meet you.
I'm Cha Seok-won.
Nice to meet you.
Same here. / Have a seat.
Were you really with a girl?
No, I was with a guy.
Can I take your order?
Coffee, please.
You can drink coke.
I'll drink coffee.
Gyeon-woo.
You're very lucky.
I heard a lot about you.
That you're a close friend.
Friend...
I need to go to the bathroom.
How is he?
No idea... but he looks nice.
He is not the man you broke up with, is he?
How do you know?
When you see a new man...
Forget about the past, all right?
How the hell do you know?
This necklace is given from your ex-boyfriend, isn't it?
You wouldn't wear it if you just broke up for nothing.
Considering your temper... and you... used to say that you couldn't get over him.
Does that means he isn't here anymore in this world.
That man is the one my mom introduced to me.
She kept pushing me to meet him Doesn't look bad, does he?
Yes.
Hey, listen!
I'm totally ok, but you should be obedient to man.
Man likes something more feminine.
And... don't drink a lot.
Some of the guys target intoxicated girls.
And it's all right with me, but to the other guys try to surrender for just once.
... not try to win.
Good luck to you.
Where's Gyeon-woo?
He left already.
He told me ten rules to follow.
I have a good memory.
I'll recite them.
First, don't ask her to be feminine.
And don't...
Second, don't let her drink over three glasses.
She'll beat someone.
At a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.
If she hits you, act like it hurts.
If it hurts, act like it doesn't.
On your 100th day together, give her a rose during her class.
She'll like it a lot.
Make sure you learn fencing and squash.
Also, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.
If she says she'll kill you, don't take it lightly.
You'll feel better.
If her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.
Finally, she likes to write.
Encourage her.
Ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention...
Gyeon-woo.
Step back behind the yellow line...
Gyeon-woo!
after passengers getting off, take in order...
Gyeon-woo!
please use the next train.
What's his name?
Gyeon-woo.
I'll do it myself.
Gyeon-woo.
Where are you?
I looked all over for you.
Gyeon-woo.
Come to the escalator.
Okay?
You're dead if you don't.
Hurry up.
Who told you to hug me?
Dummy.
You're supposed to dodge.
Sometimes I feel like I know her and sometimes I don't.
We're definitely standing at the crossroad now.
What's going on between us?
Can this relationship last forever?
Who is it?
It's me, Dad.
She told me to write a letter and bring it.
To write it on paper.
To express my feelings,
I tried hard to find the right words.
When I first met her,
I wanted to cure her grief, but now I can't give her up.
I wish we can get serious.
I'm writing about these feelings.
She's probably writing about me now.
This is how we're preparing to split up.
Gyeon-woo.
See that mountain top?
Yeah.
Could someone hear me from there?
Yes, probably so.
Or probably not.
Then go over there.
I'll shout here.
If you hear, answer me.
You want me to go over there?
Yeah.
Gyeon-woo?
Can you hear me?
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry.
I really can't help it.
Gyeon-woo.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry...
I can't help it.
I thought I was different, but I'm just a helpless girl.
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry.
Did you bring your letter?
Yeah.
What's that?
A time capsule.
We put our letters in it and bury it here.
And two years later, let's meet here again.
We'll read the letters that day, and maybe we can find an answer then.
This was her way of saying good-bye, and I kept repeating in my mind that two years isn't long.
Let's open this exactly two years later, at two, Okay?
We can meet two years later.
When we meet then, we'll be different from what we are now.
We may become closer, or stay forever apart.
We can only choose one.
Gyeon-woo.
You go first.
Let's separate here.
Should we go together?
No, I'll take the next train.
I think that's better.
See you two years later!
Okay, in two years!
Two years!
Bye!
Gyeon-woo!
That's how we broke up.
Over time
I couldn't endure the loneliness after we broke up.
Thinking of those memories,
I started to write about our stories on the Internet.
Then I made up my mind.
If I meet her again, I'll show her a different me.
Got to make use of my time.
For her and my future's sake.
Why does the ball I hit keep hitting my face?
I wrote our stories on the Internet everyday, and I kept myself busy for two years.
Yu~p!
Excuse me.
I wrote 'My Sassy Girl'.
Shin Cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.
I made her dream come true instead.
I wanted to tell her right away, but I can only wait till that day.
She didn't come.
It's our only day to meet.
No one knows when she will come.
Wow!
How did he get in here?
It's a mystery.
Gyeon-woo!
How are you?
I was so happy while being with you.
I'm not sure if you knew, but the person I loved passed away.
The day when I first met you was the day he died a year ago.
Actually, I tried to look for him in you.
I know it was wrong.
I'm sorry.
I also met him on the subway like you.
I was really sick at that time.
He did everything I wanted.
Like you did to me.
Under this tree, we planned our future together.
But he suddenly passed away.
While I was dating you, I met his mother often.
She wanted to introduce a nice man to me, but I couldn't.
The day I first met you, I came under this tree, and I prayed to him.
To let me free.
When I met you, this occurred to me.
That maybe... he introduced you to me.
But the more I met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.
The more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.
While the two of us are apart,
I want to forget him alone.
After that day, I went often to this place.
If I'm not with you after two years, it means I still lack of courage.
How much will we change after two years?
I feel like you live in the future, and I stay in the past.
I want to meet you soon, so I can read your letter.
Why are you staring at me, sir?
Because you're so pretty.
I thought an angel came down.
Do you come here often?
Sometimes.
This tree has a secret.
I have a secret here, too.
Really?
Three years ago, I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.
What's your secret?
So what happened?
We promised to read the letters a year ago.
But I couldn't come.
I guess you're a year late.
But two years didn't seem that long.
I haven't made any decision yet.
I just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.
Like what?
If we were destined to meet,
I thought we'd meet by chance somewhere.
Know what fate is?
Building a bridge of chance for someone you love.
To be honest, I read you guys letters.
I said this tree had a secret, right?
Yes.
Look closely.
Does this tree look the same as before?
Well, it looks like it changed a bit.
But I'm not sure.
People are dead or alive.
There's a dead tree and a living tree, too.
This tree was struck dead by lightning last year.
It was split into two.
But this young man felt sorry for it.
During this spring, he planted another tree that looked the same.
When he planted the tree, he asked me if it look the same.
He said that someone would be sad if it died, so no one should know.
Gyeon-woo...
(Time machine flying away...)
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
Please, call again.
Hi.
It's been a while.
You've gotten prettier.
You still look young.
How have you been?
You were in England?
Yes.
For one and a half years.
So I can forget him.
I see.
Feel better?
Yes.
A lot better.
Is it true now?
My son might be sad.
He won't.
He'll like it this way.
Good, that's what I really hoped.
Auntie!
I was getting my photo taken.
You naughty boy.
Know how long it's been?
Sorry I didn't tell you before.
This is Gyeon-woo.
Doesn't he resemble him?
When you had a hard time,
I tried to introduce you to him for several years, but he kept getting out of it.
Heard you came to Bupyung often, but you never visited me?
Go out with him.
I thought he'd make things easy for you.
Oh, yeah.
Gyeon-woo, you're going to England, right?
She's already been there, so she can give you some tips.
I don't have to go now.
Why?
You two know each other?
You may not believe it, but I think I met an old man from the future.
From your future.
This is how I met her again.
Think it's too coincidental?
It's building a bridge of chance for your love.

Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) My parents wanted a daughter, so they raised me like one.
So I thought I was a girl until I was seven.
I had to go to the women's public bath, too.
The older I got,
I thought my penis would get smaller and disappear.
But it was the opposite.
First half
Friend 1 :
He hasn't changed at all.
Gyeon-woo:
No, I'm a real man now.
Friend 2:
Hey, asshole.
Friend 1 :
Think clerical work in the army makes you a man?
Gyeon-woo:
You irritate me!
Gyeon-woo:
Give me a break, asshole.
Gyeon-woo:
My job was tougher than you could imagine.
Gyeon-woo:
Hey!
I worked near the DMZ.
Friend 1 :
Who are you kidding?
Friend 2:
hold it.
Anyway, welcome back home.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) She's just my type.
When I see my type, I can't help it.
I need to hit on her.
(cellular phone ringing)
Gyeon-woo:(In anger) Who's interrupting me?
Gyeon-woo:
hello?
Who is this?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Your mother, you bastard.
/Gyeon-woo:
Oh, mom...
Gyeon-woo's Mom:

Gyeon-woo:
Keep quiet!
It's my mom!
Friends:

Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Make sure you pay a visit.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
It's been over a year since you saw her.
Gyeon-woo:
That long?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
You know she feels lonely after losing her son last year.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
She says you resemble him.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
She'II be so glad to see you.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
still there?
Gyeon-woo:
We don't look alike.
Gyeon-woo:
plus, I hate when she rubs my face and kisses me.
Gyeon-woo:
uncle does, too.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
She'II introduce you to a girl.
Hey!
Gyeon-woo:
I know the type she likes.
Gyeon-woo:
tell her no thanks.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I want to meet a girl like the ones in romantic comic books.
But on that day... (Train arriving)
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) She's my type, but I don't like her.
Why?
Drunk girls disgust me.
girl:
Hey, get up!
girl:
Offer your seat to the elder!
Man:
Ugh!
girl:
Go!
girl:
Hey.
girl:
Don't wear pink.
(girl feeling like vomiting)
(She swallows at a gulp)
(Gyeon-woo's disgusted at the sight)
(She throws up)
(people around them in commotion)
girl:
Honey!
people:
She calls him honey!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm not...
old man:
What are you doing!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm not...
old man:
You handle this!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm not...
old man:
Think I'm stupid?
old man:
Come here!
old man:
Are you laughing?
old man:
Why didn't you look after her?
old man:
Hurry and do something!
old man:(In a rage) What are you doing?
Gyeon-woo:
I'm sorry.
Let me help with cleaning expenses.
old man:
Forget it.
Just take care of her.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) Nothing's there when you need it.
Gyeon-woo:
Where did all those motels go?
Gyeon-woo:
I hate being with a drunk girl.
Gyeon-woo:
Carrying her on my back is worse.
Innkeeper:(sarcastically) Wow, your honey wasted.
Gyeon-woo:
No, it's not my fault.
Innkeeper:
Of course, it is.
I know everything.
Gyeon-woo:
You see, we're engaged.
Innkeeper:
Western or Korean style?
Gyeon-woo:
Give me any room.
Innkeeper:
Room 405.
Gyeon-woo:
None on the first floor?
Innkeeper:
Fourth floor!
(Knock on the door)
Innkeeper:
You forgot to check in.
Innkeeper:
It's 40,000 won, kid.
Gyeon-woo:

Innkeeper:

Innkeeper:

Gyeon-woo's Mom:
What happened to your sweater?
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I'm such a poor guy.
AII this cause of a drunk girl.
I wanna die.
Gyeon-woo:(Running away) You asked if I went to Bupyung!
Gyeon-woo:
I did, but not to see auntie!
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
What?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Bastard!
Wait till he comes back.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) Know me now, right?
I'm a typical student.
An engineering major.
Study?
I'm smart, but I never study.
My parents can prove that.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
You're smart like me, but studying is your problem.
Gyeon-woo's Father:
Since you inherited your brain from me,
Gyeon-woo's Father:you'II get good grades if you study harder, idiot.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Up four points in three years.
Gyeon-woo's Father:
call this a report card?
Gyeon-woo's Father:
Since you inherited your brain from your mom,
Gyeon-woo's Father:you'II get good grades if you study harder.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) If you raise kids, never tell them they're smart.
They'II never study.
My goals?
Haven't thought about it yet.
You know now?
You got it.
I'm a hopeless student.

Gyeon-woo:

(cell phone hangs up)
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) How could she do this?

Gyeon-woo:
You were drunk, so...
girl:
Don't stumble, and speak clearly!
Gyeon-woo:
You see.
Gyeon-woo:
You were drunk and staggering at the subway station.
Gyeon-woo:
I saved you from the train.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I thought maybe this girl was a snake.
Pretending to be drunk and vomiting to use the guy in a state of confusion.
girl:
So I called you honey?
Gyeon-woo:
That's right.
girl:
I kind of remember that.
girl:
You showered to wash off vomit and sweat,
girl:and the police came?
Gyeon-woo:
That's right.
girl:
would you believe that, too?
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) To a girl like this, you need to show her who's the boss.
girl:
So I did that, right?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes, you did.
Waitress:(Serving coffee) Sorry, it's late.
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah...
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) When she's not drunk, she's just my type.
Gyeon-woo:
You look prettier and livelier than yesterday.
girl:
Are you mocking me?
Gyeon-woo:(Embarrassed) No, I'm not.
girl:
Then are you hitting on me?
girl:(directly) I don't wanna date you.
girl:
We're not destined for each other.
girl:
Throw the trash away.
Gyeon-woo:(feeling absurd) Damn it.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I think she's a heavy drinker.
girl:
You order.
Gyeon-woo:
Kimchi soup and Soju, please.
girl:(Throwing a menu card) Eat GoIbangee.
Gyeon-woo:(GrumbIing) Then you should order.

Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) She's a vicious chick.
No matter how pretty she is,
I'm too embarrassed to be with her.
Man 2:
Who are you to butt in other people's business?
girl:
Don't you have a daughter?
/Man 2:
I don't.
Bear me one.
girl:
Who the hell do you think you are?
Man 2:
How dare you?
/girl:
Come on, Iet's fight!

Man 1 :
Catch the girls.
Gyeon-woo:(Pouring soju) Have a drink and calm down.
girl:(Keeping drinking) Shit!
girl:
Ah~!
girl:(Sobbing out) Huk~!
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) Seeing a girl cry makes me sad for some reason.
She's more attractive the closer I Iook at her.
girl:
Did you blow your nose on this?
Gyeon-woo:
No.
girl:(girl starting to cry) Huk~ huk~ huk~~~!
Gyeon-woo:
please stop crying.

/Gyeon-woo:
Uh!

Gyeon-woo:(Gyeon-woo feeling sick at the girl) Ack!
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I saw her lips.
Her white neck.
And...
I saw her breast, too.
while watching her sleep like a baby, it may be forward, but this occurred to me.
I want to heal her sorrow.
girl:
Give me some water.
girl:(Getting up) Hey.
girl:
Why am I here?
Gyeon-woo:
You see.
Gyeon-woo:
I'm sorry,
Gyeon-woo:but I saw your ID, and you're twenty-four.
Gyeon-woo:

So what are you gonna do?
Just that...
Gyeon-woo:
Nothing.

Gyeon-woo:(Screaming) No, no!
Professor, it's not true!
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) She wanted to be a scriptwriter, so she kept writing stories.
She called them synopsis.
To get me into the mood, she took me to the park to read them.
Reading her synopsis was stressful.
If I miss anything, I'm dead.
girl:
Wanna die?
Finish reading it.
Gyeon-woo:
I will.

How could you throw the butt here?

Man on the street:

It's an action movie.
Gyeon-woo:

The ending sucks.

Gotta change it.
Gyeon-woo:
How?
Gyeon-woo's Father:
It's sad.
Her family couldn't afford to pay for her medicine.
Gyeon-woo's Father:
Their family line is broken up now.
Gyeon-woo's Father:
But you know, she must have been an extraordinary girl.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Why?
Gyeon-woo's Father:
This was her last request.
Gyeon-woo's Father:
When I die, please bury me with my loving friend.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:(Surprised) What?
Gyeon-woo's Father:

Taxi driver:

girl:and you'II always be with good luck.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) If I sleep out, mom beats me with whatever's in her hands.
If she's sweeping, it's a broom stick.
If she's cleaning, it's a vacuum.
When I'm lucky, it's a cucumber or eggplant.
So I have to come at the right time.
(The sound of fulling cloth)
Gyeon-woo's Father:
You studying now?
Gyeon-woo:

Got it?
Gyeon-woo:

Gyeon-woo:(Sigh) Phew~~
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) Her birthday.
If I prepare nothing, she may murder me.
I have a good idea.
Before going to the service, I worked in a theme park.
So this is my plan.
At midnight, I'II be alone with her in the park.
It'II be completely dark all around us.
One by one, the lights to the merry-go-round flick on.
I raise my arms up there, and her birthday song starts.
Then all the lights turn on and it moves.
There's fireworks, too.
Isn't it fantastic?
She'II be thrilled.
(Laughing)
I gave 200,000 won to my friends working there.
girl:
Jump over here?
/Gyeon-woo:

We have to.
Gyeon-woo:
I always wanted to come here at night.

It's my birthday, not yours.
Gyeon-woo:

There's a step here.
Gyeon-woo:
Take my hand.
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, shit!
(TumbIing down)

Gyeon-woo!
You're dead.
girl:
Wait till I catch you.
girl:
Why didn't you answer?
girl:
Wanna die?
Deserter:
Come with me!
(The sound of car passing by)
Deserter:
Hurry and get in.
(Gyeon-woo screaming)
Deserter:
Shut up!
Deserter:
Go in fast.
Move it.
Sit here.
Deserter:
If you're loud, I'II kill you.
Got it?
Gyeon-woo:(Sobbing) Yes.
Deserter:

/Gyeon-woo:(quietly) Yes.
(Gyeon-woo startled at her)
girl:
Is that a real gun?
Deserter:

Deserter:
How are you two related?
Gyeon-woo:
We're just friends.
Deserter:

You mean she could be my pussy?
girl:

I'm not a cat or anything!
Go ahead and apologize!
Deserter:

I'm sorry.
Deserter:
Anyway, friends come here late at night?
Deserter:
Why are you here?
Gyeon-woo:(Stammering) We just wanted to come here at night.
Deserter:

/Gyeon-woo:
Nothing special.
Deserter:
bullshit.
Deserter:
What makes you trust a guy like him?
girl:
I trusted myself.
Deserter:(Sigh) I had a girlfriend, too.
Deserter:
She visited me every week for one year.
Deserter:
I was so happy.
Deserter:
But that bitch fell in love with the guard house sergeant.
Deserter:
I found out the fact after he was discharged.
Deserter:(Sobbing) Damn it.
Deserter:
while I'm in the service, even my dog...
Deserter:ran away with some mutt, too.
Deserter:
My Yorkshire Terrier.
Bitch.
Deserter:
Fuck.
I came out to kill both bitches.
Fuck.
Deserter:
I have the worst luck in this world.
Deserter:
Damn it.
Deserter:
Know what special day is it today?
Deserter:
Huh, damn it?
This sucks!
(A deserter screaming)
(As if feeling sick) Uuuuuuuhhh~ ack!
girl:
Hey, what are the odds to meet a runaway soldier in a park?
Gyeon-woo:
Don't know.
girl:
Heard your head blows up if you shoot in the mouth.
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah, the hole in your head is this big.
girl:
That's serious.
A teeny bullet does that?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah, the bullet tears the...
Deserter:
Hey!
What are you two doing?
Deserter:
Stop joking around.
Deserter:
Damn it.
Damn it!
Deserter:
Even you bastards ignore me.
girl:
That's why don't be foolish.
/Deserter:
Why am I foolish?
girl:
Even if you do this, she won't come back.
Deserter:
I know.
I know, too.
Deserter:
But if I die, she'II be heartbroken.
Deserter:
She'II never be the same.
girl:
You're wrong.
girl:
The pain goes away sooner than you think.
Deserter:
You went through something like this?
girl:
Yeah.
It happens that way.
Deserter:
Damn it.
If I'm caught, I'II go to the can.
Deserter:
I'II always think of her there.
girl:
What does 'can' mean?
Gyeon-woo:
It means prison.
Deserter:
Don't interrupt.
/Gyeon-woo:
Sorry.
girl:
Anyway, you're responsible for your actions now.
Gyeon-woo:
Excuse me, sir.
Gyeon-woo:
How about letting her go?
Deserter:
If I say no?
Gyeon-woo:
Then...
Gyeon-woo:...
let me go, instead.
Deserter:
Come to think of it,
Deserter:your eyebrows remind me of that sergeant.
Deserter:
You act like him, too.
Deserter:
You can go.
Deserter:
And you...
Deserter:
We die together.
Got it?
Gyeon-woo:
Pardon?
Deserter:
Hey, lady.
Forget about this bastard, and look for a nice guy.
Got it?
Deserter:
Go!
/girl:
Let's go together.
girl:
AII three of us.
Deserter:

girl:
Gyeon-woo.
Don't worry too much.
girl:
This soldier isn't a bad guy.
girl:
You'II come out safely.
Gyeon-woo:(Sobbing) You're leaving me alone?
girl:
There's no other way.
Deserter:
I was afraid to die alone, but I'm glad we're in it together.
(The sound of radio signal)
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, right.
Gyeon-woo:
Over there,
Gyeon-woo:there's an exit near the merry-go-round.
Gyeon-woo:
Nobody knows about it.
Gyeon-woo:
I used to work here.
Deserter:
really?
Deserter:
You're not tricking me, right?
Gyeon-woo:
I'm a man, too.
Why would I?
Deserter:

Gyeon-woo:
See?
I told you so.
(The radio signal)
soldier 1 :

(The radio signal still going on)
girl:
Hey, soldier!
I mean sir!
girl:
Your girlfriend changed her mind, right?
girl:
Did you really love her?
girl:
Ask yourself.
girl:
I think you didn't.
girl:
If you really love her,
girl:you should let her go.
girl:
If not, then it's not love.
girl:
What's wrong with someone you don't love getting married?
girl:
Stop this,
girl:and go back to base as a real man.
girl:
A person like you should learn more about love.
girl:(Crying) If we want to Iearn,
girl:then we should keep living.
Deserter:(Crying) Damn it.
Deserter:
She's the nicest girl I've met.
Deserter:

Deserter:
If you do, I'II take her.
Gyeon-woo:
Can I go?
/Deserter:

(Fireworking) Pop!
Pop!
Deserter:
Thank you.
Today's my birthday.
Deserter:
I'II live on until I learn what love is.
girl:
What?
We're just friends?
Gyeon-woo:
No, I said that to save you.
girl:
Let me go, instead?
girl:
Wanted to save yourself, huh?
Gyeon-woo:
He wouldn't have let you go.
girl:
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
girl:
Have a nice life alone.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I screwed up her birthday, but I feel good anyway.
'Cause I'm proud to be with her, and things turned out as planned.
I hope you believe in me.
You can't?
Wait...
Second half
Waiter:
I remember.
Waiter:
She always came with him until last year.
Waiter:
Was it last spring or autumn?
Waiter:
One day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.
Waiter:
To not let anyone sit in his seat that day.
girl:
What's up?
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, hi.
girl:
You're early.
Gyeon-woo:
I was in the neighborhood.
girl:
Miss me?
Gyeon-woo:
Of course!
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) She always tried hard to look cheerful.
Gyeon-woo:
I Iike her that way.
/Waiter:

Gyeon-woo:
Coke, please.
girl:
Wanna die?
Drink coffee.
girl:
Two coffees, please.
(Gyeon-woo grinning) He he he~
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I know her.
She pretends to be happy, but she's full of sorrow inside.
girl:
What are you doing?
What are you smiling at?
Gyeon-woo:
No.
It's nothing.
girl:
Looks fun, huh?
Gyeon-woo:
Another one?
/girl:
Why?
Don't wanna read it?
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) She may get disappointed,
Gyeon-woo:but I should be honest for her sake.
Gyeon-woo:
Looks fun.
I'II read it.
(girl laughing brightly) Ha ha ha~
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) This time it's a martial art film.
The heroine is a bounty hunter.
The villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.
The worst of his kind.
(people around a montage in commotion)
Man 1 :
What happened?
His name's Gyeon-woo?
Man 2:
Gyeon-woo?
Gyeon-woo:
The story's setting is a mess.
Japan invades during King Sejong's reign, and the king's father is the tyrant Yeonsan.
In the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.
Heavy rain pours down on a sunny day.
(CunningIy laugh) He he he~
(Gyeon-woo screaming and running for her) Yaaaah~
(girl drawing a sword) Yup~!
The heroine becomes a king.
King Jung-jo.
She's from the future, of course.
girl:
It's fun, huh?
Gyeon-woo:
Why is the heroine always from the future?
girl:
Science is advanced then,
girl:so they invent a time machine.
girl:
And people go to the past to travel.
girl:
people from the future could be here now.
girl:
I think UFOs are time machines.
girl:
Someday, I'II meet someone from the future.
girl:
I have to.
Gyeon-woo:
If you do, ask him to take you.
girl:
What?
Gyeon-woo:
If it's possible...
girl:
Give this to Shin Cine.

girl:
Jeon Do-yun is okay, too.
Gyeon-woo:
Excuse me, we talked on the phone, right?
Gyeon-woo:

(Man feeling like vomiting) Uuuuuuuugh~
(Man throwing up) Uuuh~ Aaaack~!
Gyeon-woo:
It's going to be a hit.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) Shin Cine didn't call back.
girl:
Hey!
girl:
Hey, kid.
girl:
Is the subway your sketch book?
girl:
Don't scribble on it.
Wanna die?
Woman:
My lipstick!
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I always take her home, even to Bupyung station.
It's something a man must do.
On the way, we play fun games, too.
girl:
Left foot over the line, I win.
girl:
With the right foot, you win.
Gyeon-woo:
What's the prize?
girl:
Let's see...
Gyeon-woo:

Gyeon-woo:
No.
Then I'II change it, too.
girl:
But I'm a girl.
/Gyeon-woo:
Men and women are equal.
girl:
Okay, then.
You slap, and I slap, too.

Gyeon-woo:
You slap, and I'II use my finger.

girl's Father:
Next time, don't hang out till late.
girl's Mom:
You don't understand me.
girl's Mom:
Why'd you stand him up?
girl's Mom:
What's wrong with him?
Why do you stand guys up?
girl's Mom:
And what happened to your heels?
girl's Mom:
What's wrong with you?
girl's Mom:
I told you not to meet Gyeon-woo.
girl's Mom:
He's dumb and has no future.
girl:
It's none of your business.
girl:
Why is he stupid?
girl:
You're stupid so you don't know.
girl's Mom:
What has gotten in to you?
girl:
Let me live my own life!
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) Afterwards,
I didn't hear from her for a Iong time.
(cellular phone ringing)
Gyeon-woo:
hello?
/girl:
Gyeon-woo, it's me.
girl:
Long time no see.
Gyeon-woo:
Her voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.
girl:
Our 100th day celebration is soon.
Gyeon-woo:
It's 100 days already?
girl:
When do you think a girl's the prettiest?
Gyeon-woo:
When a sexy woman is naked.
girl:
Where are you now?
Stay right there.
Gyeon-woo:
No, I'm just kidding.
Gyeon-woo:
The prettiest is when she's playing the piano.
girl:
What's your favorite song?
Gyeon-woo:
That George Winston song.
(Gyeon-woo humming) Ta Ia Ia Ia Ia Ia~ Ta Ia~~~
girl:
PacheIbeI's 'Canon'?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah, that song.
girl:
You're not gonna ask me?
Gyeon-woo:
When is the guy the prettiest?
girl:
Just give me a rose.
girl:
still have your high school uniform?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah.
Why?
girl:
Bring it on our 100th day,
girl:and give me a rose during my class.
girl:
Do it yourself, okay?
Gyeon-woo:
What?
What did you say?
How can I during class?
Gyeon-woo:
Hey!
Just hung up on me!
Damn it!
(Students shouting to be quiet)
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I don't wanna get beaten by her, or get humiliated at a women's college.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Oh my God!
A burglar!
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
help, a burglar!
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Eh?
Are you crazy?
You're gonna break into where?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
What on earth are you doing in broad daylight?
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
And you...
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Why you didn't drop by an aunt's coming and going Bupyung for the girl.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
You never know how much hard time I went through for you.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
She even intends to introduce a girl to you.
Gyeon-woo's Mom:
Gyeon-woo!
Where are you going?
Gyeon-woo:
I'm cleverer than I Iook.
Gyeon-woo:
These girls sure love Chinese food.
Guard:
Hey, you!
Where you headed?
Come here!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm delivering Chinese food.
Guard:
I ordered it.
Bring it here.
Gyeon-woo:
really?
Guard:
Bring a Iot of radish?
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, I forgot something!
Guard:
Give me the food first!
That's the wrong way!
Gyeon-woo:
There's another customer.
Guard:
Hey!
(classroom in commotion...) (becoming as silent as death...)
(Again in commotion)
(PacheIbeI's 'Canon' begins to be played)
(Students clapping and shouting)
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) But that wasn't enough for her.
We relived our old high school days.
girl:
Drink!
Drink till die!
Gyeon-woo:
I've never had anything like this.
Gee!
Gyeon-woo:
Sorry, I'm gonna drink it in my way.
Gyeon-woo:
feeling so good!
girl:
Have a smoke, too!
Gyeon-woo:
Wow, I've never had a smoke, either!
Gyeon-woo:
Gonna be a big deal.
I don't smoke well...
Gyeon-woo:
What are we supposed to do if caught by teacher.
Gyeon-woo:
It's a suspension!
girl:
You've already had your ups and downs in life.
girl:
Go ahead and smoke!
Gyeon-woo:
Hey, you are such a tough cookie!
Gyeon-woo:
You go to very good school!
girl:
Not to worry.
Gyeon-woo:
This clothes is so tight!
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) After we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.
But she got wasted again.
Condom man:
Oh, wild teens!
Here's a condom.
Condom man:
Let's prevent AIDS.
Gyeon-woo:
Taxi!
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) She's having a happy dream.
Compared to when I Iooked at her in the motel the first time, she looks so different.
could her pain be cured now?
Maybe it means that she doesn't need me anymore.
Gyeon-woo:
Excuse me.
Can you drive slowly?
girl's Father:
Here.
girl's Father:
Have any plans after graduation?
Gyeon-woo:
actually, I've never thought about it yet.
girl's Father:
Can I see what's in your pocket?
Gyeon-woo:
Sir?
Right.
(girl's Mom mumbling without sound) 'It's a condom.'
girl's Father:
What is this for?
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, right.
I Iearned that it prevents AIDS.
Gyeon-woo:
But I haven't used it yet.
Gyeon-woo:
actually, on the way here.
/girl's Father:
Forget it.
girl's Father:'Chicks Hen'?
What does this mean?
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, right.
It's a chicken soup restaurant.
girl's Father:'We'II satisfy all your wishes?
'
Gyeon-woo:
I think it's to satisfy our tastes.
girl's Mom:(Without sound) 'Hurry and tell him.'
girl's Father:
How do feel about our daughter?
Gyeon-woo:
Oh, right.
We're just friends now.
Gyeon-woo:
please don't worry.
Gyeon-woo:
If we get closer, I'II let you know, sir.
girl's Father:
Don't see her any more.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) After that day, she never calls me.
It was sudden, but that's how we broke up.
We're broken up.
Now, I'm free.
(cellular phone ringing)
girl:
It's me.
Come to the cafe by seven o'cIock.
Gyeon-woo:
Why?
girl:
What?
I have a blind date today.
girl:
Come in 45 minutes.
Gyeon-woo:
I have a blind date, too.
(Gyeon-woo surprised)
(cellular phone ringing)
girl:
Are you on your way?
Gyeon-woo:
I'm on a date with a girl.
girl:
Hurry up.
Woman:
I have to go to the bathroom.
Gyeon-woo:'Gotta go to the bathroom.'
Gyeon-woo:(In amazement) Eh?
(Gyeon-woo sobbing as he feels mistreated)
Gyeon-woo:
Nice to meet you.
Seok-won:
I'm Cha Seok-won.
Nice to meet you.
Gyeon-woo:
Same here.
/Seok-won:
Have a seat.
girl:
Were you really with a girl?
Gyeon-woo:
No, I was with a guy.
Waiter:
Can I take your order?
Gyeon-woo:
Coffee, please.
girl:
You can drink coke.
Gyeon-woo:
I'II drink coffee.
Seok-won:
Gyeon-woo.
You're very lucky.
Seok-won:
I heard a Iot about you.
That you're close friend.
Gyeon-woo:
Friend...
girl:
I need to go to the bathroom.
girl:
How is he?
Gyeon-woo:
No idea...
but he looks nice.
Gyeon-woo:
He is not the man you broke up with, is he?
girl:
How do you know?
Gyeon-woo:
When you see a new man...
Gyeon-woo:forget about the past, all right?
girl:
How the hell do you know?
Gyeon-woo:
This necklace is given from your ex-boyfriend, isn't it?
Gyeon-woo:
You wouldn't wear it if you just broke up for nothing.
Gyeon-woo:
Considering your temper...
and you...
Gyeon-woo:used to tell that you couldn't get over him.
Gyeon-woo:
Does that mean he isn't here anymore in this world?
girl:
That man is the one my mom introduced me to meet.
girl:
She kept pushing me to meet him...
girl:
Doesn't look bad guy, does he?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes.
Gyeon-woo:
Hey, listen!
Gyeon-woo:
I'm totally OK, but you should be obedient to man.
Gyeon-woo:
Man likes something more feminine.
Gyeon-woo:
And... don't drink a Iot.
Gyeon-woo:
Some of guys aim at the girls intoxicated.
Gyeon-woo:
And it's all right with me, but to the other guys
Gyeon-woo:try to surrender for just once.
Gyeon-woo:... not try to win.
Good luck to you.
girl:
Where's Gyeon-woo?
Seok-won:
He left already.
Seok-won:
He told me ten rules to follow.
Seok-won:
I have a good memory.
I'II recite them.
Seok-won:
First, don't ask her to be feminine.
And don't...
Gyeon-woo:
Second, don't let her drink over three glasses.
Gyeon-woo:
She'II beat someone.
Gyeon-woo:
At a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.
Gyeon-woo:
If she hits you, act like it hurts.
Gyeon-woo:
If it hurts, act like it doesn't.
Gyeon-woo:
On your 100th day together,
Gyeon-woo:give her a rose during her class.
Gyeon-woo:
She'II like it a Iot.
Gyeon-woo:
Make sure you learn fencing and squash.
Gyeon-woo:
also, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.
Gyeon-woo:
If she says she'II kill you,
Gyeon-woo:don't take it lightly.
You'II feel better.
Gyeon-woo:
If her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.
Gyeon-woo:
finally, she likes to write.
Gyeon-woo:
Encourage her.
(girl breathing hard)
(Station attendant) Ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention to here...
girl:
Gyeon-woo.
Station attendant:
Step backward on the yellow line...
girl:
Gyeon-woo!
Station attendant:... after passenger's getting off, take in order...
girl:
Gyeon-woo!
Station attendant:...please use the next train.
Station attendant:
What's his name?
girl:
Gyeon-woo.
I'II do it myself.
girl:
Gyeon-woo.
Where are you?
I Iooked all over for you.
girl:
Gyeon-woo.
Come to the escalator.
Okay?
girl:
You're dead if you don't.
Hurry up.
girl:
Who told you to hug me?
(Gyeon-woo screaming)
girl:
Dummy.
You're supposed to dodge.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) Sometimes I feel like I know her and sometimes I don't.
We're definitely standing at the crossroad now.
What's going on between us?
Can this relationship last forever?
(DoorbeII ringing)
girl's Father:
Who is it?
girl:
It's me, Dad.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) She told me to write a letter and bring it.
To write it on paper.
To express my feelings,
I tried hard to find the right words.
When I first met her,
I wanted to cure her grief, but now I can't give her up.
I wish we can get serious.
I'm writing about these feelings.
She's probably writing about me now.
This is how we're preparing to split up.
(Bird twittering around)
girl:
Gyeon-woo.
girl:
See that mountain top?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah.
girl:
could someone hear me from there?
Gyeon-woo:
Yes, probably so.
Or probably not.
girl:
Then go over there.
I'II shout here.
girl:
If you hear, answer me.
Gyeon-woo:
You want me to go over there?
girl:
Yeah.
girl:
Gyeon-woo?
girl:
Can you hear me?
girl:
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry.
I really can't help it.
girl:
Gyeon-woo.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry...
I can't help it.
girl:
I thought I was different, but I'm just a helpless girl.
girl:
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry.
(Crying)
girl:
Did you bring your letter?
Gyeon-woo:
Yeah.
Gyeon-woo:
What's that?
girl:
A time capsule.
girl:
We put our letters in it and bury it here.
girl:
And two years later, Iet's meet here again.
girl:
We'II read the letters that day,
girl:and maybe we can find an answer then.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) This was her way of saying good-bye, and I kept repeating in my mind that two years isn't long.
girl:
Let's open this exactly two years later, at two, okay?
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) We can meet two years later.
When we meet then, we'II be different from what we are now.
We may become closer, or stay forever apart.
We can only choose one.
girl:
Gyeon-woo.
You go first.
girl:
Let's separate here.
Gyeon-woo:
should we go together?
girl:
No, I'II take the next train.
I think that's better.
Gyeon-woo:
See you two years later!
girl:
Okay, in two years!
Gyeon-woo:
Two years!
Gyeon-woo:
Bye!
girl:
Gyeon-woo!
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) That's how we broke up.
Overtime
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I couldn't endure the loneliness after we broke up.
Thinking of those memories,
I started to write about our stories on the Internet.
Then I made up my mind.
If I meet her again, I'II show her a different myself.
Got to make use of my time.
For her and my future's sake.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) Why does the ball I hit keep hitting my face?
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) I wrote our stories on the Internet everyday, and I kept myself busy for two years.
(gulp... gulp...) (Shouting) Yu~p!
Gyeon-woo:
Excuse me.
I wrote 'My Sassy girl'.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) Shin Cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.
I made her dream come true instead.
I wanted to tell her right away, but I can only wait till that day.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) She didn't come.
It's our only day to meet.
No one knows when she will come.
(Gyeon-woo crying out in surprise) Wow!
Gyeon-woo:
How did he get in here?
Gyeon-woo:
It's a mystery.
girl:
Gyeon-woo!
How are you?
I was so happy while being with you.
I'm not sure if you knew, but the person I Ioved passed away.
The day when I first met you was the day he died a year ago.
actually, I tried to look for him in you.
I know it was wrong.
I'm sorry.
I also met him on the subway like you.
I was really sick at that time.
He did everything I wanted.
Like you did to me.
Under this tree, we planned our future together.
But he suddenly passed away.
while I was dating you, I met his mother often.
She wanted to introduce a nice man to me, but I couldn't.
The day I first met you, I came under this tree, and I prayed to him.
To let me free.
When I met you, this occurred to me.
That maybe...
he introduced you to me.
But the more I met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.
The more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.
while the two of us are apart,
I want to forget him alone.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) After that day, I went often to this place.
girl:
If I'm not with you after two years, it means I still lack of courage.
How much will we change after two years?
I feel like you live in the future, and I stay in the past.
I want to meet you soon, so I can read your letter.
girl:
Why are you staring at me, sir?
old man:
Because you're so pretty.
I thought an angel came down.
girl:
Do you come here often?
old man:
Sometimes.
This tree has a secret.
girl:
I have a secret here, too.
old man:
really?
girl:
Three years ago, I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.
girl:
What's your secret?
old man:
So what happened?
girl:
We promised to read the letters a year ago.
girl:
But I couldn't come.
old man:
I guess you're a year late.
girl:
But two years didn't seem that long.
girl:
I haven't made any decision yet.
girl:
I just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.
old man:
Like what?
girl:
If we were destined to meet,
girl:
I thought we'd meet by chance somewhere.
old man:
Know what fate is?
old man:
building a bridge of chance for someone you love.
old man:
To be honest, I read you guys letters.
old man:
I said this tree had a secret, right?
girl:
Yes.
old man:
Look closely.
Does this tree look the same as before?
girl:
well, it looks like it changed a bit.
But I'm not sure.
old man:
people are dead or alive.
old man:
There's a dead tree and a living tree, too.
old man:
This tree was struck dead by lightning last year.
old man:
It was split into two.
old man:
But this young man felt sorry for it.
old man:
During this spring,
old man:he planted another tree that looked the same.
old man:
When he planted the tree,
old man:he asked me if it look the same.
old man:
He said that someone would be sad if it died,
old man:so no one should know.
girl:
Gyeon-woo...
(Recorded mechanical voice) You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.
please, call again.
girl:
Hi.
Woman:
It's been a while.
You've gotten prettier.
girl:
You still look young.
How have you been?
Woman:
You were in england?
girl:
Yes.
For one and a half years.
girl:
So I can forget him.
Woman:
I see.
feel better?
girl:
Yes.
A Iot better.
Woman:
Is it true now?
Woman:
My son might be sad.
girl:
He won't.
He'II like it this way.
Woman:
Good, that's what I really hoped.
Gyeon-woo:
Auntie!
I was getting my photo taken.
Auntie:
You naughty boy.
Auntie:
Know how long it's been?
Auntie:
Sorry I didn't tell you before.
Auntie:
This is Gyeon-woo.
Doesn't he resemble him?
Auntie:
When you had a hard time,
Auntie:
I tried to introduce you to him for several years,
Auntie:but he kept getting out of it.
Auntie:
Heard you came to Bupyung often,
Auntie:but you never visited me?
Auntie:
Go out with him.
Auntie:
I thought he'd make things easy for you.
Auntie:
Oh, yeah.
Gyeon-woo, you're going to england, right?
Auntie:
She's already been there, so she can give you some tips.
Gyeon-woo:
I don't have to go now.
Auntie:
Why?
You two know each other?
girl:
You may not believe it, but I think I met a man from the future.
girl:
From your future.
Gyeon-woo:(MonoIog) This is how I met her again.
Think it's too coincidental?
It's building a bridge of chance for your love.
Patient has Pneumothorax but is trapped under the panel
There are no doctors we can't perform aspiration
Send the emergency unit here now
Help me!
I can't perform aspiration, doctor!
BP 170/100, pulse 100, SAO270
Help!
I'll lose my license
I... won't make it
I'm sorry
Stay where you are!
You may lose your job, but remember you saved someone's life
Breathing is steady, BP 170/80 pulse 80, SAO295
No hospital is like that!
Ridiculous!
Dr. Wong!
Thanks!
This place requires forms for everything
You're lucky to have Dr. Wong supervising you!
He's a good teacher
This is for first visit, this is for blood test and this is for X-ray
These two are the most important
Claim forms for meal and transportation
The hospital has a liability system so write intelligibly then no one can sue you for malpractice
What?
I...
Ho Kau Kei
Yes, you're at the Ho Kau Kei Hospital
What happened to him?
Got hit by lightning
What would you do, Dr. Ho?
Take his blood pressure and SAO2
Check his optic nerve for any damage
Check for facial palsy
Most likely he won't make it
If he died in the A E, there is report to write and maybe a law suit to settle
We should send him away
You know where to?
Surgery!
Dr. Ma is on duty there
He's too busy watching horse races to treat anyone
Orthopedics' Dr. Yau I can't get along so he's out
The only one left is the old maid at General Medicine
I heard she's in love, been in good mood lately
She'll take the patient
Take him away!
Got hit by lightning at this age must've done some bad things
I've done good deeds!
I know you're a scum
No internal injury, Surgery!
This is what a lightning victim look like
God will punish you for doing bad things
I've done good deeds!
Stop explaining yourself!
Forget it!
Take him to Orthopedics
Why is he here if his bones are fine?
Surgery!
He was just there
Then General Medicine
He was there too
Take him back to the A E
Aren't you ashamed of shoving an old man to different departments?
How about that hemorrhoids patient
You sent here last time?
Your department has openings you should treat everyone!
Orthopedics is not A E's dumpster
You can't just send people up
My diagnosis comes from careful thinking and examination
I know what I'm doing
He has no fractures, not even a spondylitis
How about his bone density level?
Why don't you say a fish bone got stuck in his throat?
Time to leave!
Left-over from the last shift push him aside
He looks familiar
Every dying old man looks just like this
Send him up
You're in the way, old fart!
Move!
It stinks!
He's burnt
Old man, elevator maintenance, take a breather
I only did good deeds, nothing bad
It's okay, being struck by lightning is a natural phenomenon
When the atmosphere acquires sufficient electricity
A discharge of electricity will strike an object on the ground
Those people have no sense
You're a good man
Sorry, I'm just a new doctor
This is all I can do
Next time I'll give you a room
Brown-nosers!
This is the reality:
You kiss ass to those about you
How many doctors are actually impartial and committed?
Let's eat!
Don't let go of your hands!
Go on hitting me if you like, Sir Ho
I can take it
Don't like your food?
Order something else!
It's your treat anyway
When did he last eat?
Call for help!
AMI!
Doesn't look like chest pain, could be asthma!
It's pouring outside!
His face is turning red, he's choking
He smells!
I can't get any closer
I've never smelled anything this bad
Well done!
I feel itchy just by the brief contact
Observe carefully, girl.
This is an example of medical ethics!
It's like a miracle!
What a pity!
He'll probably make it!
She's too busy for dinner
We'll have it wrapped to go
The food's cold, I'll get her another order
She barely touched her steak
Maybe she'll like pork chop!
I'll get her hot coffee
With little sugar
Are you okay, mister?
You all right?
He was choking.
Had no pulse and heart beat
I performed CPR.
There's pulse now but very weak
So he's fine!
We won't take him then
I just had the car cleaned!
Let me...
Get in
Al, don't take him to Ho Kau Kei!
You did good, I'm very pleased
I'm not, you're not fit to be a doctor
8 years ago, I came to the hospital for Appendicitis
Pretty girl, nice body too
If the scar doesn't allow her to wear bikinis ruins her chance to marry a good family her life will be meaningless!
She's 1, 5 ft. 1
Should grow 3 more inches
Proportionally the abdomen makes up 1/3 of the human body
If we cut 1 inch lower, her pants will hide the scar
But this raises the operation's difficulty
Difficulty is not an issue
The patient's future is what counts
It's not easy to be a doctor!
It's not easy to be a doctor
I became a doctor because of what you said
But look at you now, look at your hair!
It's all greasy, what a mess!
And now you drive a Volvo, afraid you may die?
I really miss you driving your GTR and your spiky hair-do
He's fired up!
That gets him going!
Sir Ho, someone attacked you?
Who did?
I started the fight
Those morons don't know better
The 7F Management should go to hell!
They only wanted my money, not my suggestions
So I attacked them with Shaolin Kung-Fu!
They still tried to fight back
I knocked them down with the Shadow Kick
I beat them under the ground
I dare them to talk back at me
What are you doing?
Plugging your tubes back
Kid, don't move around when I'm talking to you
I want to reform the hospital but there's no one to trust
I believe in you.
You're the answer!
I can't, I'm new here
I'm ninety-something and you won't help me where's your compassion?
I'd love to help but I can't change the system myself
Okay, who do you have in mind?
Say it, I'll write it down
Nothing at this moment
Say it
Where are you going?
I think I've got the answer!
Who is it?
Who made this mess?
Accident at a construction site
Fracture in the left thigh, multiple lacerations
Conscious Index 10, BP 10/50
Pulse 110 1, 2, 3
Cross match, CBP, ECG, SAO2
Everything ready
Forceps!
Hypodermoclysis, units of unmatched blood
Blood plasma full rate, check for any internal bleeding
I need a hand!
A shot of ampoules, Defibrillator!
200!
Clear!
I had it, it was all right
Did you watch TV last night?
The show was so lame!
Give me a coffee
Any sugar?
A little
Listen to the radio now
It's hard to be a good doctor in this hospital!
Forceps!
I need a hand!
It's alcohol!
200!
Clear!
Should we go find him?
Rescue Center
Rectification
Emergency Check-up
Supersonic Welding
Give me a 23
Brake fluid 200cc, engine oil liters
Battery water 0cc accumulator plate 10cc
Clear!
Start the engine!
Joe!
How is it coming?
I welded back the chassis
How many more years can the car go?
The parts I repaired should give you another 10 years
Thank you!
We'll go in and take a look
Joe!
It's different this time
Think about it, we've got Sir Ho
I won't go back
Don't be so cold, help me out here!
Prepare the Rescue Center
Just this once!
Hurry!
Leave
If this is the way you are, I'll stay here until you say yes!
Fine, see how long you'll last
Don't leave me here
Damage all over.
Rocker arm is wasted so is the ball bearing the suspension
Get me a screw, and remove the connecting rod
It hurts
Your determination can't last 3 minutes
We've been friends for so long, let it go
I really made up my mind, trust me!
You never follow through with anything in your life
We gave our resignation when the hospital demanded reform
But you handed in a Christmas card!
Stay there!
8 years ago, I came to the hospital for Appendicitis
Pretty girl, good body
If the scar doesn't allow her to wear bikinis and ruins her chance to marry a good family
Her life will be meaningless1
She's 1, 5ft, 1
Should grow 3 more inches
Proportionally the abdomen makes of 1/3 of the human body
If we cut one inch lower, her pants can hide the scar
But the operation will be more difficult!
Difficulty is not the issue
What matters is the patient's future!
Remember, it's not easy to be a doctor!
It's not easy to be a doctor
I became a doctor because of what you said
That's not what you told me
A good doctor like you repairing cars?
You have to fix my car it belongs to my boss
I like saving cars more than saving lives
What happened?
You may fool others, but you can't fool yourself
This place looks just like an A E
So where is your heart at?
Air compression 0%, get me a pump and a drill
You will come back!
You have to help me out
You said last time I was the reason you became a doctor
Yeah
Back there you said it was because of Joe
Yeah
So who really inspired you?
It's not important who inspired me
What matters is who I will marry
What are you talking about?
Don't laugh at what I'm about to say
I can't promise how I will react
That time when I underwent the operation
I had a crush on you guys and wanted to marry you
But I can't be married to two guys at once
So I decided to marry whoever that said It's not easy to be a doctor
Don't laugh, I'm serious!
But I was drugged at the time, feeling unconscious couldn't figure out who said the words
Good, everyone's here
I hope you can tell me what you think
Say something!
You first, Benz
You know the answer already
Are you for it, Mitsubishi?
The girl made some good points
She's hot!
When she pulled down her panty
Don't go!
Don't be like that!
Stop crying!
You can't just go and leave us here
You're crazy!
Irresponsible!
Calm down!
Golf, we can't be selfish
This is a garage after all
Joe has been a doctor all his life!
Go back, Joe
Thanks
Thanks
Someone attacked you again?
Who did?
No good!
I started the fight!
The management bastards on the 7th floor said I can't hire people, won't let me sign you
So I attacked them using the Mantis Stance
Signit!
I fought very hard to get this
Kid, you're sitting on my tube
I'm ninety-something and you won't help me?
Where's your compassion?
Won't be easy to change things
There's Andy, Leon and the gang
Plus the Management Rats are spying on us
What?
Those Rats again?
I'll talk care of them!
Okay, but you have to promise me don't die on us before we succeed
Sure!
Signit!
After being struck by lightning last month at the Peak
Philanthropist Sir Ho was found at the same place this morning
He was burnt and his condition was critical
Police believes that Sir Ho returned to the Peak for Kung-fu training
When lightning hit him again
This is worse than last time!
Sir Ho
Poor old man got stuck by lightning twice
He probably won't wake up again
Maybe we should
No!
This is Sir Ho's last wish
We have to fulfill it for him!
How?
We can't win the fight without his support
Sir Ho is ninety-something and you won't help him?
Where's your compassion?
Sir Ho manages to stay alive
He kept his promise, and so should we!
Thwart their plan
They're really sneaky!
His face is pale, must be anemic
I heard they haven't left the room for years
What a pity, working in dark could result in amblyopia
Sorry, sorry!
Besides triage if the A E can help any patient, we'll do it ourselves
Every shift is 8 hours, you can't be late
Good morning!
What are we discussing now?
Being on-time!
Really?
No unexcused absence
We have to go now, bye!
Bye!
Have a good time
You have one hour to eat
No food is allowed while you're on duty
Delivery!
I ordered it!
Over here please!
I'm starving
No phone calls during operation
Hello?
I'm busy now listening to nonsense
I'll call you from the OR later
Meeting adjourned
Hold there!
You are new here, so listen carefully:
Use the first urinal to finish business, not the other ones
Cleaning all of them is too much work, trying to kill me?
You clean up your own spots!
Meeting adjourned!
You call this a hospital?
Doctors don't save lives
Cleaning ladies don't clean
That's not all
Maintenance guys don't maintain appliances
Yeah!
Pharmacists don't fill prescriptions filing assistants don't file papers
That's not the worse!
Canteen serves cold coffee soda machine dispenses warm drinks
We'll do it ourselves!
Does it work?
The stock you
Recommended lost all values
Don't worry, the owner is my friend
He said to hold on to them
How is it, doctor?
Sorry, we did everything we can
Don't cry
We'll try again, let's go!
Take it away!
It can't be done
How can you revive the dead?
I just unplugged the instruments
No breathing, no heartbeat
I'll do it
By the order of the Highest Management 3 doctors can't work on one patient at once
This is against cost effectiveness
Be aware...
Be aware
Terrible, more ribs are cracked
He should let the guy rest in peace
Yeah ...but an important reminder:
According to the Service Agreement 300!
Every patient gets 5 minutes of resuscitation procedure
You've exceeded the time hundreds of patients will be affected
This is a BBQ.
I can smell the char
The mortician will have a hard time touching up the body
One unit of Type O negative is $200
One injection is $1000
Every pack of cotton balls is $30
More cotton
He really won't give up until the corpse is destroyed
He should at least show respect for the family
In order to balance the earnings and expenses we'll either fire medical staff or reduce medical supplies
Over-budget, overtime, over-budget, overtime
We've got pulse!
Put him on Dopamine
Loser!
Bastard!
Doctor, it's okay
Are you done?
Hurry up!
We've got patients waiting!
How's my son, doctor?
He's got heartbeat we're taking him to the OR
I love you!
I saved you because it's what I do it doesn't mean I love you
Why not?
I don't like beggars
A rival!
What?
Did Yan say who she's going to marry?
What are you talking about?
She made a vow, if you said it she'll marry you if I said it she'll marry me
She'll marry me if I said it, and will marry you if you said it
No!
She'll marry you if I said it, and marry me if you said it
She'll marry you if I said it, and marry me if you said it
You have it all wrong.
Like I said
She'll marry whoever said it
That's right
Said what?
It's not easy to be a doctor
You remember who said it?
Either you or I
Good memory
Of course
What are you doing?
Every doctor has a kind heart it's the system that corrupted them
I'll remind them who they really are!
How?
Setting an example by doing everything
Will that include many meaningless chores?
The more meaningless the better!
Go for it...
Go for it
The manual
Not in Chinese?
Go for it...
Go for it
Go for it...
Go for it
3 hours left until the next shift, let's get some rest
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!
Time to work!
As usual, there's no one here
I have to go to the bathroom
You're always like this
Haven't eaten yet?
You think we can change them?
Someone plans to jump off of the building!
How can this happen?
See?
They responded!
I love you!
I found a job, I'm no longer a beggar
I don't date part-time construction worker
It's a full-time job!
I don't like someone uneducated
Buddy, don't jump!
Wait!
What are you doing?
My car!
Life comes first!
Let me move my car first!
Don't jump!
Don't make me hit you, kid!
Let me move my car first!
I've nothing to do with this!
What's wrong with you?
You hit my car!
Calm down
Don't come closer!
Tell me your problem
Too late!
I came here for Appendectomy, but had my sperm duct removed
Then a bad blood transfusion destroyed my liver
During liver transplant bad oxygen destroyed my lung years later and my duodenum is still not removed instead my body is all messed up
My boss fired me, my wife left me
My existence is meaningless!
My death will bring attention to this hospital's negligence
No, nobody will care
Look, they're busy getting their cars out of the way
Give us a little time
We are trying to make changes
This place will turn into a caring and responsible hospital
Really?
Caring?
Pay up!
You can't check-out without paying
I'm about to jump!
That's the same as checking-out, pay up
I have no money
Stop making excuses
You hit my car, I want $30,000 for the damages
$30,000, are you kidding?
You switched lane without signaling
A guy jumped down, what can I do?
Whatever!
Pay for the damages!
Cross match, CBP, full-bodied X-ray!
Saline full rate, uncross match units!
Get a drill, and diathermy
What color do you want?
What?
A E doesn't have these supplies you need to apply
Yellow is for one-month approval
Red is for one-week approval
Blue is for next-day approval
When do you need the supplies?
Right now!
Then it's the green one, but it ran out
You can submit a white form to Administration or a black one to the Highest Management
Bring it back to the 2nd floor!
Sterilize them
Life comes first, hurry!
Damn!
Can they revive him?
Hope God answers our prayer
Joe!
Joe!
Still no response
8:50, certify!
What's that thing attached to the liver?
The duodenum's got something too!
Isn't that Leon's mobile?
Does it still work?
Dentures?
Someone didn't wear his mask
He did
How is he, doctor?
Sorry, we did everything
Pay for your own car repair
Shit!
Come back to life!
I just paid off the mortgage on my car!
This belongs to the deceased tell the doctors that operated on him to pick up their things
Yes
Let's see what he's got. $1.5
Don't jump to death if you had no money
Why couldn't you do it from a cliff?
You hit my car!
They're the same because we haven't done enough
We've done a lot
Apparently not enough
Can't believe I just lost money like that
What?
You have to pay for the repair!
And where's your apology?
Andy, sometimes one's luck just hits the bottom
You
Sorry, doctors
Didn't mean to damage your cars
Sorry, doctors
Sorry, doctors
Didn't mean to damage your cars
More people are here, don't be afraid
Not afraid
We're sorry!
Find the doctor that did this to you
Let us go!
There's a ghost combing her hair
Then in an instant appeared over there!
Do I look pretty?
You girls never stop having fun.
Order take-out?
You guadvulets most not wonder around the building
People would think your brother came back from the dead!
You gave us a scare!
Thought we saw ghost!
It's safer to follow him
What are they doing?
Fixing our cars, I think
They are pretty decent people
Don't rush to judgement, see if they can fix our cars first
They are admirable we look insignificant in comparison
Andy, you can't make comparison like that
There are halos above them
No way
It's just reflection, you're ignorant
That's true
If good people have halos then should bad people have horns?
That's rubbish!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I don't like educated men, I want someone rich
We've done enough why haven't they changed?
You're right
Maybe they're not aware of what we're doing
Should we make it more obvious?
1, 2
Up and down, up and down, I am brushing my teeth around
You hear that?
They're cleaning the bathroom!
I'll be touched if they add new water
What did you say?
Doctor, I'm because of overworking
I'm not talking to you
Sell the stocks
What's your problem?
I haven't slept for days
Everything is out of focus
I can't hear things clearly
Then there's a blackout
Who turned off the light?
Then I passed out
Should we help them?
We don't want them dead here
We have no choice
Give a hand
We'll take care of you later, move!
This was a long day, I'm tired
I'm done for the night
I don't want to work to death
Looks serious
We have to find something to do
Yes, something
It's not my fault
They looked identical saidtheyweregoingtothecemetery
Anyone would've got scared and crashed his car
I'm really fine
You should treat them first
Your condition worries me more!
You may not feel any pain
But there's the possibility of concussion and internal bleeding
Make way
What a pity, we've got a patient
Another one?
That one sitting over there
Are you okay?
Yes
No really, are you okay?
Wake Joe and the other two up to help us out
Go get Joe
Lie down
How are you?
Does it hurt?
No
What caused the accident?
I thought I saw ghost
Doctor!
Doctor!
Patients are brought to the hospital
They are the quadruplets
Wake up, doctor
Any problem with your hearing?
Give me your hands
Do you feel dizzy?
No
Skull X-ray, Cat Scan!
Any problem with your hearing?
You asked me that already
I'm testing your ability to recall things
What are you doing now?
The bandage is a mess.
I'll do it over!
200!
Clear!
No one to clear
There's another one over there!
You can't just leave him there dying!
Their brother already killed himself here do you want them all to die here?
I'll help you, doctor
Defibrillator, clear!
Clear!
Certify!
10:15, certify
Certify!
I'm the patients' mother, doctor
Sorry!
We've done everything
They all signed the organ donation card
Take any part you think is helpful
Take them to Surgery!
ICU, hurry!
ICU, hurry!
Give me five!
We did it!
Thank you, doctor
It's my duty
Thank you, doctor
Thanks, Thanks
He has heartbeat but there is heart failure
He needs heart transplant now or he won't make it!
Prepare heart transplant surgery
Yes
Thank you
Please help him

What a pity!
There's a complication!
ICU won't take him!
BP 100/50, pulse 100!
His face is pale!
No urine!
Abdominal distension!
Edema of extremities!
Possible kidneys and liver failure!
Heart arrest, Doctor!
Go to the OR!
Don't just stand around, hurry up!
Should we have transplant organs standing by?
Get as many as you can
It's really not easy to be a doctor!
BP 60/30, pulse 100, SAO272
We have to hurry
Organs of the deceased don't last more than 30 minutes
You can't take back the bodies
The patient is their youngest brother!
But the bodies are already sent to other departments
What can we do?
Which form should we fill out?
Only way is to snatch them!
Liver and kidneys need to be removed
How much time left?
15 minutes
Help!
Suction
Stay focused
It's not easy to be a doctor!
What's the condition?
The heart, liver and kidneys need transplant
Bad lung, heart, and kidneys
Bad heart, liver and lungs
Bad liver, kidneys and lung
Do we have healthy heart, liver and lung?
I've got a liver!
I've got kidneys!
I've got a heart!
Prepare transplant!
The operation was a success!
I'll go visit him
Thank you, doctor
Thank you, doctor
Thank you, doctor
Thank you
It's really not that easy to be a doctor!
It's really not that easy to be a nurse!
I won the lottery with the highest prize money in the history!
I love you!
Sorry
Money doesn't impress me anymore
I like someone good-looking
Money doesn't impress you?
Money doesn't impress you?
Speak!
No!
Misappropriating organs is a criminal offense
Write!
No response
He's pissed!
Use Joe as scapegoat
How about someone else?
He has nothing to do with this
Guaranteed promotion and raise!
3 minutes
Give me 3 minutes
I never commit to anything for more than 3 minutes
This time I won't betray my friend
Let's see if I'll change my mind!
Still couldn't get a sound out of them
They're persistent
What are you doing?
Leaving this place
You're leaving too?
You didn't hit anyone or steal dead bodies
My contract just expired
Sir Ho asked me to work for 3 months
It's been that long already
And all these time the 7 Rats try so hard to make you leave
They've always been that clueless
And all this time we fought for you
Then we are stupid too?
You guys are pretty clueless as well!
What are you doing?
Leaving with you guys!
You're giving up your job here?
Right!
Do you know how to drive a taxi?
No
Want to work at 7-11?
No.
How about the bar?
You wear sexy nurse uniform to entertain men
No
Anything else you can do?
Don't go, go on being a doctor!
Yes
Take care!
Good-bye!
Doctor
Who are you?
I love you!
What did you do to yourself?
I spent all my money on plastic surgery
Am I good-looking?
Sorry, but I have a crush on a doctor
Please don't do anything more for me
Thank you
You're really good-looking
How is my car?
I'm sorry, we've done everything
This auto shop is reliable
I hope you can donate the parts
I listed here to it

At 9:20 this evening lightning struck the power plant at the Peak
It knocked out all electricity on the island and caused many deadly accidents
Most of the accidents took place at southern Hong Kong
However, Queen Mary Hospital in the area lost its back-up generator

Pacing back and forth, can't make up your mind
Don't hesitate, go!
You've been low-spirited ever since you came back
Your heart is at another place
Come out!
Everyone out!
Your enjoy talking to me from underneath the cars?
Where else should car mechanics be?
The chassis needs repair
What's with the erect wipers and the flashing signal lights?
Stop hesitating.

Someone could die!
What's your name?
What's your
Are you all right?
I'm okay, just taking a nap
How did this happen?
You won't believe it
When the car over turned the bamboo sticks flew around me
I kept ducking
and this is how it turned out
I'll get you out!
Be careful with that!
This is extremely complicated
The bamboo sticks are piled up on each other
You can't tell how one will affect the other and which one may put a hole in my body
This is trouble
Hurry, someone could die!
Where?
Stop asking questions!
What a pity!
The firemen are busy!
Don't worry...
They're here to help
Let me!
Don't!
It hurts
Be careful with the bamboo sticks!
You should've told us!
Sorry
I'm okay, let me be
Fireman said I'll be fine if there's no landslide
You blind?
Wipe your glasses!
Look!
Let's go!
It's a landslide!
We should go
Where's your compassion?
You're despicable!
I'm not that despicable?
But how can we escape?
Give me your hands!
What?
What now?
I got an idea
Leon, here!
Hold on to this, this one!
When I say 1, pull
When I say 2, push forward
You'll use the saw, and I'll cut the sticks
Leon
Give me your hand
Why?
When I say 1, grab this and turn left
Leon will use the saw, and you'll follow him
Move
No!
She could get hurt!
There's no time for that
No time?
What if you cut her stomach, or scratches her face?
We'll worry about that later, let's go!
I have a plan, it'll work
It's too difficult, there's no time
Difficulty is not the issue, what matters is the patient's future!
It's not easy to be a doctor!
It was him!
So it was you!
So it was me
We'll go with your plan
Everyone remember the steps?
Yes
That's good
One more thing, Joe
You've got the difficult job
On 1, pull 1/2 foot
On 2, push back 3 inches
On 3, move left 1/2 inch
Then pull her out
How about you?
I'll do the countdown
I'll lift it up!
That's right
I'll lift it up!
1!
2!
3!
Let's go!
How come it's not you?
Sorry, I wish it was me too
Don't play games here.
Remember, you made a vow
Life is a funny thing
Before love blossoms, it's already withered
The thought of calling you sister-in-law is unbearable
You adulterous couple!
But it's okay, from now on
You'll take her body, I'll keep her soul
Serena, you're doing it wrong
Told you he needs intensive care
Rub it on his nose ridge and philtrum
Wake up!
Wake up!
Use more
He needs intensive care!
This guy has internal injury
One dosage of diarrhea pills
He has bone fractures, 100 cc of arthritis oil
What are you doing here?
Saving people!
It's wearing me out
I thought there are two new doctors
One passed out.
The other freaked out his mom took him home
We'll take it from here
Everyone stays alert
Nobody knows what will happen next
Such as?
Everybody, because of the disaster tonight
We've decided to help out, the bathroom is in service now
You can use all of the urinals, we'll clean them all
Really anything can happen!
Turn the lights down, don't waste
A E is waiting for instructions
As if I know anything
What if they ask again?
We better sneak away
We are the highest management!
Let us out!
Help!
You rats finally decided to speak?
See what I'll do to you!
You're dead!
Doctor, you have a smile on your face
Does it mean I'm all right?
No, I'm getting married!
My wife is over there.

Take him to the Psychiatric
Cleopatra loved them.
Cassanova lived for them.
The quest for the ultimate aphrodisiac is as old as the human race itself.
Some search for nature's answer Others concoct the perfect pill...
Love aids.
Don't buy it?
Watch as we try it.
"Aphrodisiacs:
Magic or Medicine?"
Stephen Schneider, known to his friends as Schnitzy is a writer living in New York City.
At 49, he feels he is running against time.
I was seeing this great girl a ballroom dance instructor named Jamie, she taught me to tango and fox trot it was really quite cute and we were together 5 or 6 years and then a few years ago we broke up
and I felt pretty bad I have to say for a few years
I didn't feel much like seeing anybody, was eating donuts you know those crispy cream deals, it was bad and I was starting to look like Homer Simpson and I felt awful and I felt the pressure of you know my life moving on
and the millennium coming forward and I thought, you know what, it's time to do something different and find another girl.
Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love inspired the word aphrodisiac.
Aphrodisiacs are things said to arouse or intensify sexual desire or performance.
For Schnitzy, it began with some advice from a friend.
I went up to my old college Ithaca college, saw my old friend Amy who I went to college with, long frizzy redhaired gal, burns candles, plays the dulcimer, just a whole different kind of person.
And she was already into these things aromatherapy and aphrodisiacs and she said "you'll feel better you can change your outlook you can change the way you physically feel, and physically perform and I said 'whoooa, OK and so Amy really turned me on to the whole
aphrodisiac world.
From time immemorial people have done just about everything in pursuit of better sex...
Cleopatra, it was said, drove Mark Antony out of his mind by mixing honey and almonds and applyingg the tantalizing paste to her most private parts.
Casanova was reputed to eat dozens of oysters a day and it is said he once seduced a vestal virgin by sliding an oyster from his lips to hers.
And the ancient sex manual the Kama Sutra, suggests milk and honey, enhanced with the testicles of a ram for a guaranteed night of passion.
The tradition of using libido enhancers may be over five thousand years old,
but is there any truth behind the folklore?
Until the early 80's, most scientists had dismissed traditional aphrodisiacs as frauds.
But researchers are now finding that some do stimulate more than the imagination.
One popular substance that has been eaten, sniffed and smoked all because of its reputed aphrodisiac properties is the bark of Yohimbe a West African tree.
A series of studies found that Yohimbine, the active ingredient in Yohimbe did raise erections in men by increasing blood flow to the penis.
And with the Yohimbe you wanna take vitamin C -1000 milligrams to help in case you have a nauseous feeling.
It enhances the properties.
Oh, OK, whatever properties I can enhance, the better.
They say on the box that it will take 8 hours to work.
Eight hours?
!
So you have to brew it in the morning.
And how long does it last just so I git my timing down?
I bought some Yohimbe in powdered form it's supposed to actually give you an erection for three days is what they say, uh you know I would have been happy with a couple of hours.
So I tried one form of it, a powdered form and basically
I just got sick you know I was nauseous for two hours.
Yohimbe works in several different ways.
One of the ways is to increase circulation and the other way is to stimulate the nervous system.
It does however have some downsides in that it can stimulate heart rate, raise blood pressure and can make one feel a little anxious, nervous and even a little nauseous, so that, sometimes that may not be the most desirable effect
that you want to have in an aphrodisiac.
So despite its availability as a prescription drug,
Yohimbine is not guaranteed to work and should only be used under the guidance of a physician.
Many of the herbal aphrodisiacs including Yohimbine work by increasing blood flow to the genitals.
When we're sexually stimulated by anything-physically mentally or chemically- the nervous system sends signals to the pelvic region the control center for the erection.
These signals prompt the blood vessels in the genitals to dilate, bringing in a rush of blood that inflates the erectile tissue.
The veins then close, preventing blood from flowing out of the organ.
The result... is an erection.
One popular aphrodisiac is Gingko.
It comes from the leaves and nuts of the oldest family of trees- the gingko tree, and has been used in Asia for centuries.
Schnitzy decided to give it a try.
I drank this gingko tea, I'm not sure if it's a placebo effect or not but in my case I defimitely feel like Gingko helped rush blood to critical parts of my anatomy which paid off with a Fin Air stewardess.
In the last 30 years, 300 studies have given clinical evidence that Gingko can benefit the entire body in addition to having aphrodisiac qualities.
A German study of men with erectile dysfunction found that Gingko restored potency in half of them.
But how does it work?
Ginkgo may work by stimulating the brain to release nitric oxide in the erectile tissue of both men and women.
This causes the blood vessles to widen, more blood flows in and we have an erection.
But the jury is still out on how safe and effective Gingko is.
It can have side effects such as headaches and shouldn't be taken with aspirin or by people suffering from heart disease.
Hundreds of millions of dollars a year are spent in the pursuit of pleasure and the ingredients of love potions come from all parts of the world.
Each culture finds its own aphrodisiacs, depending on what is locally available.
Desert plants have been used as libido enhancers for centuries.
It is said that North American Indian girls once combined ginseng with snake meat, gelatin and wild columbine then secretly added it to the meals of the young men they wanted as husbands.
One plant that has been used as an aphrodisiac in the Southwest is Damiana, a shrub native to North America.
Chemical analysis shows that it contains substances similar to caffeine that can increase sensitivity in the genitals.
It is also reputed to induce erotic dreams when drunk at bedtime, but Damiana has not been approved by the FD A, so its effectiveness remains anecdotal.
In Asia, there are countless substances believed to have aphrodisiac properties.
Many of these make their way across the globe.
One is a Chinese herb called Yin Ya Wo, otherwise known as Horny Goat Weed.
What's the deal with the Horny Goat Weed here from China?
There's folklore information that says that Chinese goat-herders noticed that their male goats were acting, in quotes, randy...
Randier than goats?
Randier than the goats in other parts of the pasture and they found out they were eating a particular weed and the weed they named Horny Goats Weed.
And it worked for the Chinese shepherds?
Well it worked for their goats I guess they started using it also.
Well, you know what I always say Joanne, what's good for Chinese goats is good for me.
So with all these love aids available, is there any way to figure out which ones will guarantee sexual pleasure?
Researchers have made some progress by ruling out some legendary substances that can do more harm than good.
Spanish fly is perhaps one of the most well known so called love elixirs.
Made from the dried bodies of beetles it works by severely irritating the urinary tract, sending a rush of blood to the genitals.
Today, Spanish Fly is illegal in the US and the FD A warns that it is a poison that can cause death, a high price to pay for better sex.
But the quest for better sex is often costly.
In Asia, animal parts have been used for centuries.
The testicles of bulls and rams were once eaten in the hopes of becoming more verile.
And the phrase 'feeling horny' is said to come from the idea that animal head ornaments were considered aphrodisiacs.
Powdered rhinoceros horns are still used in Asia.
Even though there is no proof that they work as an aphrodisiac.
Although many traditional aphrodisiacs do not have the firm backing of science, some have enjoyed their positive effects.
But whether Yohimbe or Gingko can help your libido, may depend on whether you believe it will.
Really, the cool thing about this aphrodisiac thing honest to God I'm not positive that it really works but you think it works and it has actually made a change for me.
After Jamie I went for a couple of years and I was miserable then as I started eating oysters and drinking champagne and taking Gingko
I started feeling better and I started meeting more women.
Coincidence?
You know I don't know but recently I met this woman from Spain, Alehandra who was really quite great unfortunately she lives in Spain you know so all the oysters in the world aren't going to help 6,000 miles of ocean, so um I'm still looking.
Legend has it that seafood has been considered an aphrodisiac ever since the mythological Aphrodite was born from the sea.
But some say there's more to 'sexy' foods than just folklore...
Hot, spicy, sweet, juicy, words that make you wonder if someone is describing a great meal or a great lover.
Since the beginning of time food has been inextricably linked to our sexuality.
Historically mating rituals involved having a meal or banquet before sex and even today the act of eating is so linked to the act of lovemaking, that sex therapists sometimes prescribe a romantic meal for two, as an effective form of foreplay.
Maria, she loves to eat, so I mean there is something I know
I can be always giving her especially a good, I would say dinner.
And then comes the romance and the sex is where, I can use that and then lure her in.
Frank and Maria met in a Chicago mall two and a half years ago and the chemistry was instant.
Maria works as a bookkeeper and Frank drives a truck and for them, food is often the answer to keeping the flame alive.
He loves whipped cream and so do I, and strawberries and syrup, Oh, yes.
So we try to make it interesting because you know sometimes if you just do the same thing all the time it just doesn't work.
But historically the lure of food as an aphrodisiac has had a lot more to it than the sharing of a romantic meal.
We have historical books that tell us about the use of foods for example in the Kama Sutra, they describe a meal of eggs and onions with cardamom cinnamon, and nutmeg.
If you have that before you meet your lover, your chances of having a better experience are greater.
Before science began exploring how our bodies work, people followed a premise known as the Law of Similarities.
This dictated that what a food looked like determined how and where it could benefit the body.
So if a food looked like genitalia it was bound to be an erotic stimulant.
Legend has it that the Aztecs in ancient Mexico were so impressed with the anatomical likeness of the avocado that they named the food ahuacatl or testicle, and forbade village maidens to set one virginal toe outside while the fruit was being harvested.
Many of the aphrodisiac foods were just thought to be aphrodisiacs because of their appearances like bananas asparagus, carrots because of their phallic appearance.
But asparagus for example has very rich nutritional value, it has vitamin E, which is considered one of the sex hormone stimulants it's a vitamin that stimulates our hormonal production.
So it seems the ancients did get it right sometimes, because many of the foods that were considered aphrodisiacs actually have vitamins and minerals that are essential for a good sex life.
One of the most visually suggestive love foods is the oyster.
Said by some to look like testicles when in the shell and by others to blatantly suggest a woman's anatomy,
Oysters are also a good natural source of zinc, a mineral necessary for the production of testosterone, believed to be the sex drive hormone in men and women.
But, some argue that you would have to eat dozens of oysters for them to jump-start your libido.
Not all of the fabled foods' powers have to do with their vitamin and mineral content.
When it comes to being a hot-blooded lover, the chili pepper may hold the key.
The spicy substance in hot foods called capsaicin causes nerve endings to release substance P, a neurotransmitter that stimulates a burning sensation.
Our pulse is raised and we sweat more just as we do during sex.
Some believe that eating hot foods can also trigger the release of endorphins, body chemicals that give us a natural high.
And of course there is the ultimate lovers' gift -chocolate.
Used for centuries as an aphrodisiac part of its lure comes from its sensuous melting quality.
If you're talking about like sweets or something like that it would have to be like chocolate syrup.
You know because for one it's sweet, and it's, it's durable, you know I mean you can place it wherever you want you know, and then.
And you know the next place it's going is your mouth so it's like you get 1 and 2.
Chocolate contains a substance called Phenylethylamine which is a stimulant, it's considered the love chemical.
It gives one a sense of well being and excitement.
And that's thought to be a chemical it's very similar to the endorphins that our body produces that give us that natural high.
Some scientist believe this chemical in chocolate is broken down before it can 'turn us on', but others say it may be one of the reasons why lovers will be buyingg up to 36 million boxes of chocolate in the United States
next Valentine's Day!
The writer Dorothy Parker has become legendary for sayingg,
"I wish I could drink like a lady.
I can take one or two at the most.
Three I'm under the table.
Four I'm under the host!"
Aside from the fact that a bit of alcohol reduces our inhibitions, some studies have found that alcohol actually raises testosterone levels in women but not in men.
But drinkers beware.
Too much alcohol, in both men and women, will put anyone's libido to sleep.
Chicago Classic Rock Station, CD94.7.
Hi, this is Dr. Alan Hirsch and we're looking for couples to volunteer for a test of kissing to see what odors and food tastes will enhance arousal.
Just give us a call...
Okay, so what I want you to do is put your head back, stick your tongue out that's good.
And kiss.
Maria and Frank are 2 of the 500 neurologist, Dr. Alan Hirsch has been testing.
Over the last five years he's worked to measure the effect of taste and smell on arousal.
I had heard that Dr. Hirsch uses food to enhance the sexual pleasures and stuff and so I was interested in that aspect of it because I thought that maybe we could bring something new into, you know, the bedroom.
I want you to rate how much you liked the kiss, or disliked it.
How sexy you thought it was, how much you liked the way his kiss tasted, how much you desire to have another kiss from him.
Okay.
We began to study using foods as aphrodisiacs because we found that when people lose their sense of smell or taste they develop sexual dysfunction.
So the connection became apparent.
Almost 100 years ago, Sigmund Freud said that in order for us to remain a civilized society we had to repress our sense of smell, otherwise we would walk around sexually excited all the time.
Dr. Hirsch has been testing this theory for over 10 years.
Up to 3,000 test subjects later he has found that certain food smells are so sexually exciting they actually increase penile and vaginal blood flow.
When we inhale an aroma odor molecules enter the nose and stimulate small hairs called cilia to send messages to the brain.
One part of the brain that receives these messages is the limbic system, often called the 'pleasure center'.
The signals then travel down to the spinal cord, and just like the food and herbal aphrodisiacs, cause blood to rush to the genitals.
The food smells Dr. Hirsch's studies found to have the greatest effect, aren't exactly foods we associate with a night of passion.
Of all the food smells he tested he found that Pumpkin pie was the way to a man's libido increasing penile blood flow by 40%, buttered popcorn came second increasing blood flow by 9%.
And the most arousing smell for women was the licorice candy
Good Plenty.
The curious thing Hirsch's study found is that all smells actually arouse men to some degree.
Women, who have a much more sensitive sense of smell, were more discerning.
What we found was some odors inhibited female sexual arousal, for example the smell of cherries had a negative effect, the smell of barbecue roasting meat and the smell of men's cologne all acted to inhibit female sexual arousal.
Despite Dr. Hirsch's studies, smell remains the most mysterious of all our senses and we are still not quite sure why these food smells affect our libidos.
But for Maria and Frank, the flavor and aroma defimitely enhanced the sensation.
I forgot about the people in the room.
It was just me and him, you know.
I didn't feel like, like it was a study.
It was just and, it made you it made me feel a little bit you know, wanting him a little more, and then having to stop when they said stop.
I'm like, oh, okay.
We can't do anything else.
Vitamins, minerals and a delicious aroma may enhance a night of passion, but the secret to the ultimate aphrodisiac may lie within the body itself.
The human body is forever surprising and delighting us
and aside from the obvious lures of beauty and seduction, the body itself has its own powerful aphrodisiacs.
These come primarily in the form of two body chemicals- hormones and neurotransmitters.
The hormones testosterone and estrogen are mainly secreted by the sex glands, which form part of the endocrine system.
They are essential for our sex drives.
Some, neurotransmitters, like Norepinephrine and Dopamine are released primarily from the brain and send messages throughout our bodies.
They trigger our sensations of pleasure and arousal.
But when the body's natural love stimulants shut down, some people go in search of help.
Mike Albano, a 59-year-old computer technician for the stock market, classifies himself as a "Type A" personality.
He turned to Chinese medicine after his high-pressured work environment became too much to bear.
We live in a society today in New York City that's so fast paced, you have to make it today, you don't make it tomorrow.
It's what you do for me today that counts, not tomorrow.
So it's under a constant lot of pressure that you have to go through every day, and I was part of the rat race.
Mike was suffering from stress a condition that affects 75% of Americans.
I think if we look at the effects of stress on health and sexuality overall, stress is probably the most common cause of low libido.
Mike's lack of libido and general ill health began to have an impact on his 30-year marriage.
There was no communication, there was no closeness and stuff like that.
Performance weighed heavily on my mind, because I knew deep inside that I wasn't doing what I was supposed to be doing for my wife and for my lover.
And the desire was weaning, it was practically disappearing.
When the body itself loses its own capacity to stir the libido, aphrodisiacs often become more of a necessity.
Determined to get his body up and running again, Mike decided to try acupuncture.
He put his trust in the hands of Chinese herbalist and acupuncturist
Adele Reising.
Oh good it looks so much better.
What I did for Michael was I started him with weekly acupuncture treatments to increase his overall energy.
And in the course of our therapy I asked him if he had low sex drive, and he said he did.
It's a question I commonly ask because it gives me information about the person, about their overall energy level and from a Chinese perspective their source energy.
Acupuncture is said to stimulate nerve paths, and some claim this causes the brain to release neurotransmitters which heighten desire.
Others believe acupuncture may also help blood flow.
How you doing Mike?
Great, totally relaxed.
Good.
OK.
By promoting circulation through the use of acupuncture you can help with sex drive because part of what has to happen is the area has to be infused with blood in order for normal sexual function to occur, both for men and women.
According to Mike, weekly sessions of acupuncture and a combination of Chinese herbs including Ginseng have helped put him back on track.
From the very first session with Adele, I brought a list of medications I was taking and she went through them all and she had told me that one of the specific medications
I was taking would have an adverse effect on my intimacy which I,
I totally was having.
And she said one of the benefits of acupuncture that it it flows with everything else and it would make everything come along better than what it was.
And it put the oomph back in to your life.
It put the oomph back, my oomph back with the oomph, oomph.
Our relationship is now more intimate, more enjoyable.
And we're able to get out and do some things, take a walk when we want to.
We're back to where we once were.
The intimacy has improved to the point where has heightened
Yes, has heightened.
And we have the oneness back again.
Some of the body's most potent aphrodisiacs are our aromas not the obvious unpleasant smells like nervous sweat.
Rather, each person has a unique smell print made up of pheromones.
Pheromones are chemical substances released all over the body, but especially from the armpits, the genitals and under our hair.
We are surrounded by clouds of these molecules and leave trails of them as we walk.
Some of these signals smell some don't.
It is believed that they are picked up by the noses of other people, who are either consciously or unconsciously attracted to our smell.
Pheromones act in many ways for other animals as I guess what you'd call an aphrodisiac or at least as a sexual cue for an onset of sexual behavior.
They also do other things.
There are alarm pheromones, there are mating pheromones, of course there are courtship type pheromones, there are weaning or suckling pheromones, so they act in many sorts of ways.
Whether or not a pheromone could act as an aphrodisiac in humans
I think is still a little bit of an open question.
Some studies show that there may be a link between pheromones and our sex drives.
In one double blind experiment young women were exposed to either pheromones or a placebo.
During the first three weeks of the test, 36 percent of those receiving the pheromones reported having weekly sex.
By the fourteenth week the number doubled!
And researchers say it wasn't just the power of suggestion, as the group exposed to the placebo experienced no change.
But, if pheromones are the source of chemistry between two people who are instantly attracted to each other without knowing why, the perfumes and scents humans can detect could also be considered powerful aphrodisiacs.
Some believe that smell is the sense most closely linked to our sexuality.
Although sight and touch are also essential to our sex drive, their signals must pass through areas of the brain known as the thalamus and the cortex before reaching the limbic lobe.
Aromas however, send signals directly to the limbic lobe provoking a more powerful emotional reaction.
But what happens when we combine the lure of scent with the supposed power of pheromones?
Perfumes are now being used not only to enhance the fragrance of the wearer but since the early 90's, companies have cashed in on the idea that pheromones help sell products.
One success story is Perceive, Avon's new pheromone perfume.
Out for only six months in 54 countries, this "mood enhancing" fragrance has become the number one selling perfume in Avon's history.
This is one of my customer Victoria's neighborhoods.
I typically come out here to deliver to her and then I might come through the neighborhood and see if I can't develop some more customers.
Oh right, let's see what we have here today.
I brought you that Perceive purse spray that you had ordered.
Yes, I need to freshen this up a little, get my mood going a little...
Perceive's effect comes from synthetic pheromones said to be "mood-enhancing".
These synthetic pheromones are meant to help relaxation reduce inhibitions and may enhance relationships with friends and lovers.
My relationship with my husband has even changed because I'm happier, I'm more self-confident,
I feel sexier and he's liking that you know.
Oh wait till you see what else I brought.
It's Perceive for Men.
You gotta be kidding.
Nope, nope
Does it have that same thing?
It has that pheromone thing happening, yup.
But some are skeptical about the effectiveness of pheromone perfumes
The pheromone molecule that they contain or the supposed pheromone molecule that they contain, really has I think has not been tested rigorously or rigorously enough to really know whether it has any activity.
And then of course there's the issue as to whether it'll really do what you want it to do.
After all if you splash a pheromone on and it truly is a pheromone then your expectation is of course it'll attract all the beautiful people in the world who will desire you and want you.
But in fact it'll attract anybody with a nose.
While research into the effectiveness of pheromones continues, there is one part of the body believed to be the center of it all.
I think our brain is defimitely an aphrodisiac.
So many things go into our sexual response-what we smell what we see, what we hear.
Our brain is the main computer that will integrate and tell us what we're all feeling and these things will stimulate us sexually.
If our bodies themselves offer us the most powerful aphrodisiacs, from brain chemicals to natural scents, perhaps good overall health and fitness can help ensure sexual success.
In the last decade, health club membership in America has almost doubled.
But although tight abs and firm thighs may be pleasing to the eye, trying to attain a beautiful body might not be the only reason to have a good workout.
Researchers are finding that regular exercise leads to better sex.
One California study polled 8000 women nationwide.
Of those who did some type of aerobic activity regularly 40% were more easily aroused:
31% had sex more often and 25% reached orgasm faster than women who didn't exercise.
But is this simply because exercise brings increased self-confidence or is exercise provoking any chemical reactions inside our bodies?
A vigorous workout can contribute to a release of beta-endorphins also known as 'feel good opiates'.
Endorphins are primarily found in the pituitary gland in the brain and are distributed throughout the nervous system.
They are thought to be connected to our feelings of euphoria changes in appetite and the release of sex hormones that are essential to our sex drives.
Hello, welcome to the show.
We're here to challenge you today with some new ways of thinking about your sexuality, about intimacy about love and life.
Sex therapists Karen and Greg open up their New Jersey phone lines for their regional radio show 'Love Matters.'
They counsel listeners whose love lives may need a little boost.
We have Maggie on the line
Hi Greg, Hi Karen.
Hi Maggie, welcome to the show Tell us why you're calling.
I'm 32, I'm married with two kids.
And both my husband and I are really busy, we have demanding jobs and we have demanding home lives and now it's not that the spark is gone, but it's defimitely waning.
Greg has been a sex therapist for over 30 years and Karen for 15 years.
For them, sex has always been a priority.
10 years ago, Greg was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a progressive, disabling illness that affects nerve cells in the brain and spine.
Since I figured that MS was going to be time-consuming and energy consuming,
I had to get rid of everything that I figured was unimportant and save my time and energy for the things that were important- so I got rid of everything but sex.
Determined to keep their sex lives vibrant, and to be able to advise their patients and listeners on the latest libido enhancers,
Greg and Karen turned to exercise in their case, the eastern practice of Tantra.
Tantra for us becomes an exercise of both mind and body.
From the body standpoint, it helps us build the energy that we have, and it also helps us, release energy you know that goes into stress and it allows us to gain a relaxation and a joining then of each other.
We think of it as building energy through breath through postures like yoga postures and that this energy that we build is part of our expression of loving of payingg attention to one another of increasing the joy and vitality in our love.
There are two distinct ways to apply exercise to sexuality.
The Western approach is to emphasize the physical by spending hours on the treadmill or lifting weights.
In the ancient cultures of the East however, it is more about the mind and body connection with a very strong focus on sex, so exercises such as Yoga and Tantra were developed.
Like some herbal aphrodisiacs Tantra and Yoga are said to help blood flow.
In yoga there are many exercises that because of the particular posture they will stimulate blood flow to certain organs.
And specific yoga exercises are geared towards improving the function of the ovaries the adrenal glands and the pituitary hypothalamus.
And it's the relationship of these organs together that helps our sexual function flow smoothly.
Aside from increasing blood flow to our sex glands, yoga also includes specific exercises that can be used to make sex better.
Some exercises help strengthen the muscles in the pelvic region, while others can help control orgasm and ejaculation.
Karen and Greg practice Tantra every week.
And although science has yet to prove that this type of exercise can directly stimulate the sex glands, many people like Karen and Greg find that regular Tantra does lead to better sex.
Stretching is really one of the best exercises that I can do because it allows me to be flexible.
And even with your MS, you're actually more flexible than I am which annoys me, but the Tantra exercises help us to build and keep sexual energy high.
For Karen and Greg, Tantra proved to be the answer to their sexual dreams, but for others, dance is a great sexual enhancer.
Throughout history, dance has been used in courtship rituals and often as a prelude to sex.
Indeed, dance often has the excitement, release and exhaustion characteristics of sexual climax.
Dance is defimitely an aphrodisiac.
Many of the Latin dances for example are very sensual and very sexual.
Many of the rituals involved in mating in various different civilizations involved dance.
For Karen and Greg, exercise has defimitely helped to enhance their sex lives, but sometimes, we need a prescription to perform.
Vast strides in medical technology have helped to make the issue of sexual performance a 21st century obsession.
While our quest for the perfect aphrodisiac continues, have we replaced the potions of the past with the pharmaceuticals of the future?
Has the art of love become the art of science?
In the United States it is estimated that over 58 million men and women may suffer from some form of sexual dysfunction.
The cause could be physical psychological or both but drug companies are competing to find a cure.
Perhaps one of the most well known pharmaceuticals today is Viagra.
To date over 16 million prescriptions for Viagra have been filled in the United States alone.
But Viagra is just the tip of the iceberg in the medical quest for sexual success.
Erection medication is so popular it is boasting over
$880 million dollars of sales and new treatments continue to hit the market.
There is a myth that these medications will enhance and create super sexual beings, and I think that that's something that's a risk as well because we don't want to become too intercourse focused as a society.
We don't want to become too goal-oriented.
But to some, many of these drugs are nothing short of a miracle.
After Greg was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, he suffered from erectile dysfunction and had to face the reality that medical assistance was needed.
His doctor prescribed Caverject- the first prescription medication approved by the FD A for erectile dysfunction.
For Greg, this meant having an injection before sex.
Caverject and penile injection therapy is not scary at all.
Because I'm the one who used to pass out just at the mere thought of getting a shot, and this has never been a problem.
What's so neat about this is just how well it works and how quickly it works.
Not that, you know, spontaneity tends to be overrated but it's nice not to have to wait an hour.
OK.
And we load it in here...
And put this on...
You ready?
Oh yeah.
That banana has no feeling whatsoever.
And the medicine gets delivered and it's wonderful, viola.
For over 15 years, the pharmaceutical industry has targeted erectile dysfunction in men.
But now, the race is on to find the magic formula for women.
We used to think that male erection problems were primarily psychologically, or emotionally based, and now we've come to learn that in fact most male erection problems are physical or organic, meaning that there is a medical basis for them.
And we are just now, we're 20 years behind the men, but we are just now beginning to realize that as far as female sexual function, there are in fact a significant number of medical and physiologic processes that can affect sexuality in women.
A recent study conducted by the University of Chicago found that over 40% of women in the United States may suffer from sexual dysfunction.
The result - drugs ranging from estrogen rings to blood flow creams that enhance genital sensation are being developed at a frenzied pace.
The best candidate for medication is a woman who was satisfied with her sexual response at one point in time, and now for whatever physical reason whether it be a pelvic surgery, or menopause or medication, is no longer able to respond as she once could.
This time of life has caused sexuality, the drive that is, to wane a little bit.
One could only imagine that women all over the world at my age are perhaps experiencing the same thing.
One could only imagine that even Sophia Loren must be you know going through this experience as well... 55 year old Petrina Wells is not alone in her concern.
In fact, it is estimated that over 24 million women around the world reach menopause every year.
With aging and menopause, women experience a variety of changes in their sexual function, being increased vaginal dryness increased pain with intercourse, changes in their ability to become aroused, difficulty achieving orgasm, and those changes are primarily due to the change in the hormones.
Unlike many menopausal women around the world who accept their waning sex drive in silence,
Petrina, set off to Canyon Ranch spa in Tucson, Arizona to consult women's health expert Dr. Lana Holstein.
I see so many women who have complaints like Petrina's.
They come in stating that they really are troubled and frustrated by their lack of desire.
They want an active sexual relationship with their partner.
They're in a good space in life.
And yet they're really feeling a lack of this sense vitality when it comes to their sexuality.
Do you feel like you're in menopause or mid life?
Probably in the middle way through that.
Ok, and are you on any hormones now?
I am, yes.
OK.
So are those like estrogen or progesterone?
Has anyone talked to you about testosterone?
Doctors have long been prescribing hormone replacement therapy for men suffering from impotence and women going through menopause, but today testosterone is the one that pharmaceutical companies are targeting as the next best libido prescription.
If you don't have any testosterone I think you do have trouble accessing your level of sexual interest or desire, so from my point of view, it is a very important aphrodisiac if you will.
In other words, it's a substance that we need to have in our body in order to access that want that desire.
In the age-old aphrodisiac quest modern medicine is finally offering some alternatives.
If you're talking about an aphrodisiac or an agent for lust it is testosterone.
And um, we're just in the very beginning, early phases of understanding the role of testosterone in women, but that is the hormone of desire in both men and women.
For Petrina, the testosterone treatment may offer her the opportunity for many more years of passion with her partner Rusty,
and she will need to follow-up with her doctor to monitor the effects of the medication.
But be it pharmeceuticals or age old aphrodisiacs, the goal remains the same.
I think its part of our human nature to keep searching for something better and as we discover more substances, we'll probably learn so much more about our physiology and be able to discover newer and greater things that will turn us on.
So while our quest for passion continues, most people seem to agree, that no plant, potion or pill alone can promise satisfaction.
Perhaps the ultimate aphrodisiac is love itself.
All of this aphrodisiac stuff of course we're talking about lust you know, if you will, my goal and I think most people's goal is actually love, and to the degree that lust gets you to love
and then enhances love, hey you know
- I'm all for that.
The best aphrodisiac is the decision to be erotic, and knowing yourself well enough to know what kind of stimulation what kind of circumstances, what kind of conditions you need to have met in your own life to be turned on.
You're talking about sex.
So, if somebody feels that they want something, that aphrodisiac is probably going to heighten that sexual thing,
But for the moment I think.
But the thing is, if you got love love is gonna keep that memory all the time.
The ultimate aphrodisiac is love and being with Mike.
You betchya.

The End
Government?
Sons of bitches...
Who made it anyway?
...
They even killed Kim Ku, and I couldn't die when I should have
Since then, I lived each day hoping it'll be my last
Since that day... that day...
Shanghai
On that day, I was to die
I set fire to Japanese houses whenever I could
It was to avenge my parents' death
And then I got caught
Many arsons and murders occurred in Japanese districts
Today, we are here to execute the principal offenders, these Chosun people
You should be witnesses to today's execution, and spread the word
How reckless and foolish it is to fight against the Great Japanese Empire
Many arsons and murders occurred in Japanese districts
Here are the villains... of political and other sorts... to be publicly executed
They were anarchists
That was how I met them
Here's where you'll be trained
Look closely
This is Majaal, who makes the bombs and weapons for us
Hey, don't touch my knife!
That's right.
That's the way
Where are you pointing at?
You're driving me nuts!
Black looks good on Sang-Gu!
Like a bell boy at the club
Yeah, he's the bell boy
Do you know why we prefer black clothes?
If the socialists are red then anarchists are black
Throughout history we only wore white, a sign of weakness
And we should mourn for our old timers, right?
I wear it 'cause I like black
Wow!
Looking good, huh?
Listen!
Keep straight and don't breathe
Look at me when I'm talking!
Hello
Ling Ling!
How 'bout a hug today?
Ling Ling Light them up well with the mirror
Why we always have to take our pictures from him?
It's too damn dull
Still, Mr. Wang's the only one to treat us with dignity
Ready?
One... two...
Three!
Hey, get up for a minute.
Get up, I said
Try reciting our declaration
People are our principal spirit of revolution
Louder!
People are our principal spirit of revolution
Violence is our only weapon of revolution
With our people, we will overthrow the Japanese rule
With assassination, destruction and rebellion.
We...
We will rebuild our tortured life under Japanese rule
And as a first class society there will be no suppression
Without any, without any oppression to our fellow men,
We will build an ideal Chosun nation...
That day, I was officially accepted into the group
Hi Seregay Hey they sure look silky
My!
Why do girls always like his kind.
Drives me crazy!
Wow!
Let's stuff ourselves to death
Drink up!
Those bitches sure know how to roll their hips around
Sang-gu, do you see those Japs, over there?
That's Minami Soja.
He's been dispatched to Shanghai
To the right is Gato, his pawn
In front of him is the cold-hearted Kuboda
You'll meet them soon
When should we kick their butts?
Kaneko-san!
Many foreigners are here
In Shanghai, there's a lot of armies from many countries
So what if there are?
We can crush those Japs and hide with the French
So far, they're good to us, but they have their own moves
Our provisional government is there too and it's best that we don't trust them too much
What are we doing?
Let's drink up for those buffoons
The only buffoon here is you.
Cheers!
You idiot!
You're an imbecile!
Go outside to throw up if you don't feel well, Sang-Gu
Seregay consoled his pains with opium
They're beating him up!
Give us the money now
What are you doing?
We want our opium money
But did you have to...
Seregay!
Hey guys!
Look who's here?
It's the Queen of the club!
What do we have here?
So!
You got a knife?
Let's see what you can do, you son of a bitch!
Get lost!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Come on!
I'll take him home
You're home late
You have a funny hobby
Well, yes, that is...
You seem to turn the pages with perfume
Oh, now what should I do?
I was really saving it up...
I hardly used it...
Who told you to bring me here?
Well, I'll see you later
We'll get an order from above
You just wait a bit, okay?
Hey you!
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
Yesterday you got fancy food and you threw it all up
And now you...
You rotten bastard.
You all right?
Sang-Gu!
Go and get the pictures from the photo shop
Yes, sir
Now eat, okay?
Hello.
How can I help you?
Photos?
Photos!
Wait one minute
Here...
Photos
In the photo, you're not pretty
You should smile
Smile!
No...
Have a cup of tea Yes, sir
Have you scrubbed yourself well?
You could get sick without some scrubbing now and then
Yes sir, I have
I need to scrub off filth
What do you mean?
Please get to the point
A while ago, Han Myung-Gon received some subsidy from Lenin 2 million rubles was delivered from Moscow to Shanghai
But a 1 00,000 rubles of that just disappeared into thin air
You mean, Kim Lib took it?
Kim Ku already killed him
Everybody's talking about it.
It's an issue for both parties
Then is it true that Kim Lib's money went to Dan-Jae?
Dan-Jae says he knew nothing, but he received 500 rubles to write 'The History of Chosun'
The problem isn't the 500 rubles, but it's the missing 1 00,000 rubles
The provisional government thinks that we took it all
All the leftists, including Lee Dong-Hui, Shin Chae-Ho and Kim Won-Bong are all under suspicion
Isn't it manipulated by the Rhee Seung-Man's side?
That's why he broke off the leaders' meeting, didn't he?
I heard that they couldn't find that money in the end
Han Myung-Gon thought it was dangerous to carry it alone
So he entrusted a part of it to some guy
But that guy ran off to Russia to keep it for himself
We finally found him
Kill him and bring back the money
In two months, top Japanese officials will be in Shanghai
Probably conspiring to take the rest of China
Is that so?
Wow!
We finally got a big one for us
Now we can make our names famous in history
Dol-Suk, it's your turn
I brought a guest.
Please greet him
A Minister of Provisional Government, Mr. Ahn Chang-ho
I already spoke to your leader, Mr. Kim, and I advise you to stop your terrorism from now on
Especially, the foreign settlements are absolutely forbidden
We're risking our lives by sneaking into those areas
And you want us to just watch those Japs kill our brothers?
Why judge everything only by the things you know?
Thanks to the protection from the foreign settlement officials, thousands of our people can be safe in the French districts
So you'll keep bribing them with protection fees?
Now the Japs will expand their power into these areas
Then it'll be the last of diplomatic immunity
Terrorism is barbarism, and it's internationally condemned
We have to change our society through enlightenment
Look, you think terrorism is all about guns and knives, but that's the decent part of it
The Japs should be hacked to death
Dol-Suk!
Sir!
Let me take care of that damn Governor-General
I'll finish him with my blade
Our guest is leaving
Show him the way out
You fellows think carefully about what I said
Seregay, here's the photo and the address
I'm standing here!
Geez!
What's wrong?
Are you sick?
My headache's worse
Let's get it treated for good after you get back
After I leave, you sleep with her
Help me fall out of love
Before a big kill, we always took a picture
Since it could be our last moment alive
One
Two
Three
You know that dancing lady?
That lady's your girlfriend?
Am I right?
But a gun is more reliable than a knife, right?
It depends on how you use it
He's enormous
Then there's plenty to stab at
A Russian hooker went in
She looks expensive
I guess he's got the money
Will you cut his throat or stab the heart?
You want to be the next Sabinkov?
Find out for yourself what killing is like
I think a stab in the heart will be better
The important thing is to avoid the ribs
Insert vertically under the left nipple
Don't you miss home?
Now it's not home anymore
I heard you were from a royal family
It's been a while since I threw away my family name
I saw you reading a very interesting book
About anarchism
It's the ideology of the person that I love
So you learned the language of the one you love?
I was born in Chosun.
My mother was a Chosun woman
Will you give me the honor of a toast with the royal family?
Seregay!
Seregay!
Seregay only sent me back
We divided the money to reduce the risk
But Seregay didn't come back
And I came back eating only eggs for 7 days
Our leader was furious and ordered us to bring him back
The other members were sent
We were completely excluded from the operation
But with Lee Geun's efforts...
Seregay was handed over to us
Did you forget how he protected us when he was tortured?
He's also very sick, and he's not himself
You shouldn't have saved him without any authorization
In the end, you got in the way of his honorable death
Since then, Seregay's wasted...
Still, that's not fair!
How can they tell us to kill a comrade?
There are hundreds of members besides us
You know that we're being harshly punished for them
Why do you ignore that?
You don't care about Seregay at all
You care that it's humiliating since it happened to us!
Let's stop it there
Please take the life that you saved
There's been a change of plans
Seregay was a great fighter
An activist who didn't need anything at all
Maybe Seregay was never meant to be one of us
I heard the gunshot from the opposite side
I was afraid and the guys didn't know what to say
Those who are here today have no right to mourn
That's because we are still cowardly alive
During last Kwang Dong earthquake,
Japanese had mercilessly massacred thousand of our people
With the remaining ashes of a Chosun fighter in front of us,
I dare declare...
He was in a such a bad state that we had to cremate him
We found out that Minami, Gato and Kuboda did it
For whatever it takes, we intend to seek retribution
Let's renew our resolutions
All members and officials of the Provisional government, please remain to take a photo in memory of today
Everybody, look over here One, two, three
Hey Kuboda!
Where's Minami-san?
I don't know
You don't?
Idiot!
Oh, Kaneko-san, it's an honor for me, Minami
What's the matter?
Did you have to take advantage of Kaneko as well?
What?
I'm trying to relieve the sadness of a woman who...
You made no scruples to attain your goals
You're exploiting Kaneko
Don't forget that hundreds of our people are dividing into nationalists or socialists
How can we bring them together to fight our enemy?
I'm talking about your coldness to use women in a revolution
You said that a rebel is cold
- Hearted as well as passionate
That terrorists are cold flames
You, me, Kim Ku and Dan-Jae, we're being exploited for the revolution
Isn't your judgment these days being obscured by a woman?
You...
What are you guys doing?
For Minami's death, Kaneko was tortured
By the despicable Gato and Kuboda, a Chosun national
They just used you for their terrorist activities
Do you know how Seregay died?
They killed Seregay
This is Seregay
Hey!
Look what we have here!
Which hometown you from?
I'll show you what a real Chosun man is like, okay?
Lee Geun consoled Kaneko in place of Seregay
The group silently accepted that she informed him about the Japs
That's new
What are you doing?
It's Seregay's
Don't touch it
What's wrong?
I drank coffee from it lots of times
Is this your place?
Are you my husband?
And please don't use that form of speech with me
Why do Chosun men do that when they get acquainted?
Use it on your Chosun girls
I'm different.
I'm Japanese
Sorry.
You call us Japs, right?
I never thought of you as a Japanese woman before
Why is only Seregay dead and not you as well?
If you're comrades and rebels, you should all live or die
You hypocrite!
Do you think there's any meaning to be alive?
Christ, those two kissing away like they were long lost lovers
Well, I guess she'll be going
What's up, Dol-Suk?
Oh!
You're here.
Want a cigarette?
Huh, are you leaving?
Let's have a meeting
We've got important info on the new Jap's Consul General
Wait!
Stay still!
You can't go out alive
What happened?
Shit!
Listen to him, Kuboda Drop the gun
Drop the gun!
Do as you're told.
Please!
Let's go!
Go away and listen to me
Don't follow me
Listen to them, Kuboda
It's no use running away
Shut up!
You son of a bitch!
You're dead, you bastard
Take it off.
Off!
You shit!
What are you doing?
To eat a boiled egg, you have to crack its shell
No!
What do you mean by no?
We'd be no different from them.
This is inhuman
Inhuman?
Animals don't do anything like this
Then what's a human supposed to do?
What are you supposed to do in a situation like this?
Just kill him Kill?
Now that's very human
Is this all you learned while being tortured by the Japs?
There's an informant among us
If we don't find out, then we'll collapse
It's not about choosing to be human him or not, but figuring out who you'll be human us or the enemy
There's no choice
If I keep insisting then you'll be suspicious of me
No, you've already started to be suspicious of me
What are you talking about?
Why didn't anyone tell me you were hiding in the bathroom?
My great responsibility for...
That's enough!
I don't want to hear any more of it
Who's the informant?
I don't know.
I just do what I'm told
Bring the electric generator, okay?
What's keeping you?
I said get a move on it!
If you think you're right, shoot me
Where are you going?
Is Gato dead?
Why'd you do it?
Why betray like that?
Betray?
Wasn't it you who betrayed first?
He was shot several times in the back, you say?
There was no time for you to recover the body
Then what was it that we buried?
The real Seregay is right here
So, it was all for this
Yes.
After killing the only man I loved, did you have to go so far as to use me to kill Minami?
Tell me why the hell did we have that fake funeral?
Was it to keep the truth from me?
You punished a traitor and used a woman's grief for your cause
You guys are geniuses
What makes you different from the Japs?
What gives you the right to ask about betrayal?
What is betrayal, anyway?
Leave Shanghai
We hid out because there was a search warrant out for us
Insufficient subsidy, crude weapons and an informant...
Many of our activities failed and we were falling apart
We needed a new change...
Even if you don't eat much, your hair sure grows fast
So is that why your first love ran away?
My first love, Chun-Mae
She had the biggest breasts.
So I...
Ouch, it hurts Hey kid, sit!
Come sit here, I said Sang-Gu!
I'll be straight with you
We decided to move to the leftists' base at Kwang-ju
From now on, we fight for a collective rise of socialism
Now, you'll be reborn as socialists at Kwang-ju
We're anarchists
Socialism is just another dictatorship
What do you want, then?
I want to work and take as much as I can
Just as I expected.
Well, you can't beat that
But it's true that terrorism has no place here anymore
I devoted my whole life to it
You need ten years to match the number of people
I've killed
What's the use.
They replace a Jap as soon as one goes down
Even if we kill the Emperor, his son will take his place
But terrorism is...
All right.
Do as you like
Anyway, our leader won't be responsible for any more sacrifices of young patriots
Please finish your meal
I came down here not to serve nobles and Japs
Do you know what my dream was?
It was to die like a hero with style in Chosun or Japan
Forget orders!
Just wipe them out.
You just wait and see
There's gonna be something really surprising
Then all of you...
So what are you going to do?
I knew for a while that the age of socialism will come
But as sick as I am, what could I do in Kwang-ju?
And how could I lead others?
I'll just stay here with my comrades
Then you're all on your own
Whatever you do next, don't mention our group's name
Name isn't important to us
There will be no more financial support after today's lunch
Sang-Gu, do you know the original meaning of 'Anarchy'?
In Greek, it's 'Anarchia', 'anarcho'
What does it mean?
A group of sailors without a captain
You bums!
What are you doing there?
Come over here
Pay the rent The rent, I said
I'm sorry
Is that edible?
Want some?
Damn it!
You can have all you want!
I heard that 1 00 cooked carps will cure lung disease
Sang-Gu, come with me
You're sorry?
You think our kids live on water?
No matter what, I want my money
Give me the money now!
I'll give it to you later
Don't try to trick me today.
You understand?
Hey, what's there to look at?
This knife is from Arabia
It's my knife so I should know
This knife is the real thing
This is all I can give you What?
Hey, do you know what kind of knife this is?
Kid, what you doing?
Take the money
Place your bets
If you don't fall in one minute, get double
If you make him fall, we give 1 0 times the bet
Shit, what's he saying?
If you hold out for a minute they give you double the bet
If you fall, then you lose
What if I win?
You get 1 0 times the bet
Give me half of that money
I never saw him fall once.
Just give me the money
God damn
- It, you asshole!
Come over here!
Wait a minute!
I'll be back What?
Start!
We won, eh?
Hey, give it here.
Sang-Gu, eat some more, okay?
Hey kid, is your stomach getting greased up enough?
This restaurant is the best and the most famous in Shanghai
Eat all you want, huh?
The guys must be hungry, too...
Don't worry
I got it all figured out
This was delicious
If we get this for the guys, then...
Ling Ling
Where's your grandfather?
He was arrested for being involved with the Chosun people
We had to close the business
It was a cold and poor winter
Just do as I tell you...
I've had enough of it.
Shut up!
Why do you always do that to me?
Is what I say that worthless?
Are you out of your mind?
Then you really want us to be petty thieves?
Somebody else will do it even if it's not us
What do you think, Han?
Sang-Gu, you should listen too.
Come sit here
This Shanghai mob is looking for a new face
We just hand over the drugs and get the money
It's enough money for our weapons and living expenses
Anyway, everything will be over in a month, right?
I think that...
Be quiet!
Who asked you to think?
Leave the thinking to us
You stop there!
I'll tell you about my hometown.
When my father worked as a servant on the farm, the landowner said I was an ignorant who didn't know
what a sickle is
So I took his sickle and slit his throat
Bastards!
I thought they were my comrades
You don't know how important this is to me
Sang-Gu, after this, you go off on your own
I plan to do something on my own from now on
Put your hands up!
Hands up!
Put your hands up and don't move
You!
You put this in, you bastards
Stay right there!
Turn around!
Hey, I could've done it alone.
Ah, shut up
You could at least say thanks
What's up with the clothes?
If you're small in number, always have an alternative plan
What are you doing there?
Come on
That's not the way...
What?
It's this guy!
Now let's make them remember us
For the old timers at the Provisional Government to see
Let them have all the credit What good are they, anyway?
In 1 91 0, the traitors sold the government to Japan,
Now, the minister of the Provisional Government are selling the pseudo-government
Yeah, you're right!
But Mr. Kim's different
Kim Ku's struggling a lot to provide for the old timers
Let's just eat.
Hey!
What's wrong?
Kim Ku beat and killed Japanese officials, just like us
Dol-suk!
That was Mr. Kim Ku
What's this?
Oh, shit!
Let's get out!
In a week, from Daedal Pier at Hwangpo River, a cruiser with Japanese officials will depart from here, then pass through Inchon and arrive at Tokyo
Again, careful how you act
Especially you, Dol-Suk
Why do you always pick on me?
But, will all the head Japs really be meeting there?
The cruiser seems difficult
We do a preliminary infiltration
We make sure of the cruiser's structure and size in advance
Even if we fail, dead or alive we will still make it to our homeland
I hope all of you will take the risk
I really miss my homeland
Steamy bean soup and the girls, I just can't wait!
But security must be tight
There's less soldiers on the cruiser than on land
There aren't many places for them to hide in
Our worst scenario is sinking the cruiser
Don't worry.
I'll kill them with my bare hands, if I have to
Please don't forget about me when you go back home
And Sang-Gu!
You just follow me
Dol-Suk!
Now, why'd he trust you out of all of us?
Why do you say things like that?
It drives me crazy!
And...
Don't get so excited Hello!
They were the best that we could find in weapons
They were crude, but we were confident with that
You'll have your ID papers at the rendezvous
You know what to do, right?
Whatever happens on the cruiser, we don't know each other
Dol-Suk and I will attack first with pistols
If we succeed, then we can all safely go to Inchon
If we fail, the second team attacks
Now we'll really do something for history, huh?
Let's all go back home after this big kill, okay?
We'll go to Seoul and make our way through
What do you think of my opinion?
I wouldn't let you down.
I have a good feeling about this one
Today will be our last day in Shanghai
I'm sure we all have things to do
Be especially careful of how you act and dress
So is this the last time?
Then what are we doing here?
Anything fun to do?
Yes, there is
Hurry up
Here we go!
Ready?
One, two...
What's that expression?
Smile!
Hey, did she take it already?
Did you take it?
Yes...
Yes...
Good
Write a phrase to put on the photo
What's this?
Life is heavy as mountains, but death is light as feather
Let's split.
We meet tomorrow morning at the rendezvous
We split?
Don't we all have things to do in Shanghai?
Take care.
I'll bring the car at exactly 8:00 in the morning
We won't wait more than 1 0 minutes
Later, you tell me what you did with Ling Ling, okay?
You look like a monkey
What's wrong?
Ling Ling, I have to go tomorrow at seven
Don't forget about me, and buy yourself lots of delicious stuff
Consider yourself lucky!
You go back to your hometown
I said, go back!
Have a good life
Do you still think that I'm connected with Seregay's death?
The things that we're doing, are they really our ideals?
What do these things mean to us right this moment?
The important thing is that we're together
Let's leave the ideals and the dreams until after the mission
Excuse me
Kang Dol-Suk
You're a petty thief disguised as a revolutionist
You think killing a couple of Japanese people will bring independence to Chosun and make you heroes?
Your ideals are over
Even after their death, they could not return home.
They failed, but they were still heroes...
A revolutionist is like a gust of wind that blows towards this filthy world from a far away beautiful land
When I got out of prison, it was after the independence
The pro-Japanese Noh Duk-Sool became a police investigator
He arrested and tortured Leader Kim Won-Bong
He was accused of being a communist
After three days of loathing, he went over to North Korea.
Today, I am to receive a medal from the President of South Korea,
Rhee Seung-man
It's an honor of my small contributions to our nation
Does President Rhee deserve to give anyone the medal?
Today, at the ceremony President Rhee and I will be meeting our fallen brothers
Sang-Gu, do you want to try?
Sang-gu take a look, they're all yours
The Russian Revolution was achieved not by individuals but by the masses
Sang-Gu, black looks good on you
What matters is that we are together now
There was an ideal land for us
So free and pure that it could not exist in this world...
From the time of Diocletian.
Roman drama.
The centurion Sebastian meets the christian Fulia.
Sylvia, the beloved of the emperor, surprises the two lovers.
The diversions of the emperor.
Sylvia, who persecutes Sebastian with her zeal, charges him with the emperor as a christian.
The emperor orders Sebastian's capture.
On the track of the guilty.
The martyr's death of Sebastian.
If One Could See Into the Future
The angel of life points the path followed by Death
Do you want to go through?
Give me your hair.
In the Kingdom of Death The clocks of life
The fountain of Fate
There it is.
Your son's life!
Childhood
In his twenties
Damn you life!
Stop his life...
Death is better than dishonor.
Who would have thought that my daily view here would be of a cemetery?
TURKISH PASSION
We should have learned to please, to seduce to deceive to know what is in men to see them coming.
And, in that way, dominate them.
The females of the apes, our first cousins...
Don't say that, I've only had two.
Those females are much more intelligent than their males.
A little.
Like this bit of candy.
And how am I like a female ape?
Are there no stupid apes?
I feel happily stupid, for the moment.
A bad start, Desi.
A clever ape only gives her male the right to mate with her.
That is, screw her.
In the broadest sense of the word.
And pity the poor ape who believes it's her duty and not a pleasure.
Duty is a pleasure for me.
It's easy to see you're going to the altar still a virgin.
Thanks to the bishop.
Your man is delightful.
A real Prince Charming.
The best match in this city.
And the best looking.
And undoubtedly the most delicate.
But when all's said and done, he's a man.
I say polite things like this to my husband.
"I like your cock you bastard."
"I like it so much."
"Don't come so hard, you'll kill me."
"Yes, like that you son of a bitch."
Things like that, understand?
You think yours won't want to hear them?
You're both so crude!
I don't know why I'm thinking of the holy water font now.
The one that's right behind us.
With eleven indents on the rim and one at each end.
When I was little in your arms, Dad I'd soak my hands in them.
If your mother were here...
How handsome he is!
Marriage is like a blank check.
You can write fabulous amounts on it but it cannot be cashed without the signature of the account holder and that is God.
Today's check has that signature in advance.
Desideria and Ramiro will increase the number of zeros as the need arises, because children will arrive the flower and fruit of marriage because from today they are two "in caro una" in one flesh.
They have the angels' congratulations and the nightingales' applause.
I don't know if I'll be able to show how much I love you.
I don't care, honestly.
Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday, dear Ramiro,
Happy birthday to you.
Make a wish.
Well done!
First things first.
Be happy, happy, on your birthday.
Ramirito, may God bless you.
May there be peace on your birthday.
And may you have many more.
Come on, children!
Children!
Juanito!
Toni!
My Toni loves me so much.
Look at what I've got.
And for Juan too.
Kiss, kiss, kiss for Aunt Desi.
Here, take this, my darling.
Go on, and be careful.
You had them, but they're mine.
You're such a mother hen!
As you like kids so much, why don't you have one?
I can't have any.
An obstetrician in Madrid told me so.
- It was time I told you.
- What know-it-all dared say that?
They told my grandmother the same and she got a natality award.
They're only guessing.
I'll be godfather to the first three.
You're right.
You end up sick of kids.
Meanwhile, we can lend you ours so you can practice.
Just one week.
That's enough.
Two weeks.
- What is all this?
- We're going to Turkey and we thought...
I accept.
It's impossible.
Why?
Because we're going too.
A husbands' plot.
What about a toast?
To Turkey?
- To Ramiro.
- To Turkey.
Is it true about the doctor?
Yes.
Don't lose heart.
There's something stronger than doctors.
I'll never reproach you for anything.
You're enough to make me happy.
Do you hear?
Yes.
- What is it?
- I feel dizzy.
You don't look well.
Girls!
Come on!
I can't stand the smell of spices.
Spices?
What do you mean?
I was told that Turkey smells of spices, of soup with spices.
- I can smell it now.
- I don't smell anything.
I do.
And I can't stand it.
Maybe your gynecologist was wrong.
First shot of your expressions in Istanbul.
Don't look so serious.
Arturo, I have your camera.
We are in Byzantium, in Constantinople, in Istanbul.
Welcome.
Constantine VI, Emperor of the East called Asia Minor Anatolia.
It means "the country where the sun is born".
In the glorious era of the Ottoman Empire the West invented the image of a barbarous Turk.
This was adorned with a complaisant tendency towards sensuality.
Neither was true.
Europe's idea of us has always fluctuated between fear and enchantment.
Western civilization was born here with Miletus, Anaximander, Heracliteus.
Gods, heroes and the Christian apostles.
The Iliad and the Odyssey.
We Turks are Europeans like you.
Don't be afraid of us.
Skyscrapers are as much a part of Istanbul as St. Sophia and the Topkapi which you have come to see but the city still has that charm acquired over the centuries.
Istanbul lies between two worlds, two seas, two continents, Europe and Asia.
Two of the seven wonders of the world...
She fainted.
She's been feeling odd.
- You're all right, aren't you?
- Ramiro?
I'm here, don't worry.
- Are you pregnant?
- Be quiet.
You're feeling better.
That's good.
Are you all right?
Calmer?
Will he bite?
Will it hurt when he bites?
My name is Yaman.
It means "the only one".
And I will do anything so that you fall in love with this country.
Turkey is paradise, ma'am.
"From Istanbul to heaven." Don't they say that in Madrid?
Coffee, sherbets, the ottoman the divan and raisins are all Turkish inventions.
And who hasn't heard of, or tasted, Turkish delights?
Our baths, ladies and gentlemen, are famous throughout the world.
When you were still in the Dark Middle Ages we lived in a world of pleasure and voluptuousness.
We are arriving at the hotel.
You can rest, or do whatever you wish because this guide is at your complete and entire disposal.
- How are you?
- I'm fine.
You see to the cases.
Marcelo!
- Arturo, the camera!
- He took it with him.
- Have you got over the dizziness?
- Yes.
May I?
Thank you.
Forgive me.
Welcome.
What's your name?
I'm still called Yaman.
- Which means "the only one".
- That's right.
- My name is Desideria.
- It's a pretty name.
Desi...
Come on.
Laura!
- How are you?
- I'm fine.
I won't ask again.
We'll give you the all-clear.
You can rest until lunchtime.
I don't think they have a siesta.
We have two options.
A siesta and a visit to the mosques.
Or the cisterns and mosques and no siesta.
Which do you prefer?
A siesta.
What about you?
As you wish.
When the Turks took possession of Constantinople in 1453 one of the first actions by the Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror was to bury in this spot the man who had been...
The mosque and its mausoleum were built in 1458.
And soon they were surrounded by a huge, well-shaded cemetery in which the Ottoman nobles and pious people wanted to enjoy in a posthumous way the benefits of the holy man's proximity.
The light, as you see is reflected in the marble and in the ivory of the ninety nine windows with lattices.
That number corresponds to the ninety nine names of Allah.
Once the capital was conquered Mehmed II ordered a search for the remains of the martyr, and when they had been miraculously identified thanks to the dream or vision of a "shi" he ordered the building of a mosque venerated since then by all Turks.
An earthquake which took place at the beginning of the 18th century caused serious damage and it was rebuilt in the year 1800.
The tomb of Eyup is one of the most interesting monuments in Ottoman Istanbul.
As well as its walls of 16th century ceramics you can observe the strange religious behavior of the Turkish Moslems.
The holy man's tomb is in the innermost of the two patios behind a grill through which the pilgrim can offer his prayers or request a spiritual favor.
Let's take a look.
Those of you who didn't go to the Cisterns can join the repeat visit in an hour's time.
I'm thirsty.
- Will we have a drink?
- Sure.
Come on.
How many rolls of film did we bring?
Four.
- And where are the others?
- I don't know.
- Want a beer, Desi?
- I forgot something, you go on.
"Those who tend the bath will wash you at your pleasure.
Not only the Turks use this, but the Jews and Christians too.
I myself did it every fortnight and felt very well.
One of the things the Turks rightly label us as is dirty.
No man or woman in Spain washes twice in a lifetime."
- When is that from?
- 17th Century.
Anonymous.
A Spaniard imprisoned by the Turks.
I'm not leaving without trying a bath.
- Where's Desi?
- I don't know.
In the toilets, perhaps.
Listen to this about the harem women.
Look.
There's Desi.
"If your appetite is for long marrows, cucumbers or similar fruits, they bring them cut in slices."
Is anything wrong?
No, nothing.
A bit of a turn.
Will we get a doctor?
Desi is uneasy in this country.
Aren't you, Desi?
I'm amazed at you.
Someone's coming.
There is the pirate captain seated in his chair.
Asia on one side.
- On the other...
- Seville!
Europe.
And there before him, Istanbul.
Sail on fearlessly, my craft.
No enemy vessel, nor storm, nor calm can alter your course or overcome your valor.
I must be mad.
Slip away in the bazaar tomorrow.
Wait a minute.
A photo over there in the alley.
Marcelo, there.
That's it.
Stand a bit closer together.
- All right?
- Come on!
Right, let's go!
You can come in.
Come and see what a carpet shop is like.
My brother will serve you.
I want to buy cuff links for Ramiro.
I'm going to sneak off.
How did you learn so much so quickly?
Desideria...
You're leaving tomorrow.
What will become of me?
Tell me, what?
I love you.
I don't want to be just a silly affair you had in Istanbul.
Yaman...
I want you for ever.
Pass it on, man!
Christ, you're an idiot!
How can he do that with the ball?
He's stupid.
I'm pregnant.
Who was it?
I don't know.
It isn't true.
And you said you couldn't.
I lied.
When you lie about that, Desi, you have to take precautions.
Come on.
Let's sit down.
We'll talk.
We could have done it before.
I knew that you knew.
We didn't need to talk.
Except for Ramiro, we all knew.
But we thought it was over.
Now I see it isn't.
What will you tell Ramiro?
The truth.
You're crazy.
You can't tell him the truth.
You can't go on living like that.
I have never spoken three sentences to you without referring to this tumultuous feeling which has enslaved me since I first saw you.
I am waiting for Ramiro.
Despite what Laura said, I'm going to tell him the truth.
I've got some news that will please you.
We're going to have a baby.
They were right, you can't trust doctors.
I have something to tell you.
I saw a doctor in Madrid too.
I'm the one who can't have children.
Or both of us.
Although it now seems you can.
What will you do?
That child shouldn't be born.
That may be so.
But I'm determined it will be.
Forgive me for saying that.
It's against my beliefs.
Divorce.
Divorce?
That would make me the laughing stock of our friends.
- Is that what you want?
- I just want to have my child.
Who's the father?
- A Turk?
- Yes, a Turk.
Do you realize what you've done?
What has that Turk got?
I'm sure you don't really want to know.
It's you who has to choose.
You'd break with all the child represents?
Yes.
Do you swear?
I prefer my child to be reared in our home.
Then all will stay as it is.
He's lovely.
- How's the mother?
- She's really happy.
It was a very quick birth.
Here you are, with Mom.
My love.
Will you love him?
Isn't that lovely?
Yes, it is.
Come to Mommy.
Come to Mommy.
Come to Mommy, Ivan.
Ramiro!
It's the baby!
My love.
What happened?
Call Don Angel.
There, my love.
There, my love.
At last.
My car's broken down and there were no taxis.
- He's hot and he has convulsions.
- Let me see.
What happened?
We were sleeping and I felt that he was choking.
All right.
Prepare a cold bath, quickly.
What is it, doctor?
Why isn't he moving?
What's wrong with my child?
No, it can't be, it can't be.
But why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
I'm sorry, there was nothing I could do.
Why, God, why?
Why?
My baby.
My God!
What a tragedy for poor Desi.
She wants to be alone.
To meet again after so long in such circumstances.
It's a very sad time.
My son...
Your mother is going mad.
She tried to forget and couldn't.
Now she wants to think you are showing her the only way.
The last chance to put some order into her feelings.
It's an appointment I must keep.
I'm leaving you in your little child's grave.
You won't miss me.
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you.
My baby.
My baby.
When you come back, I won't be here.
You know why I am going and where.
Just one justification.
I'm mad and I want to listen to my madness.
I renounce any settlement.
Desideria.
Where is Yaman?
Yaman.
Yaman Dunbar.
Orteisar.
- Orteisar?
- Orteisar.
Thank you.
It's me.
It's me.
It's me.
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait.
Wait, I don't want you to move.
That's it, stay like that.
That's it.
I like to feel you like that.
Inside me.
Not moving.
Yaman...
We had a child.
He died recently.
Will we have more?
I want you to forget everything.
I want you to be another woman.
But will we have more?
Of course.
If God wishes.
Your God or mine?
They both have to wish it.
Even if they don't.
It's a wedding.
The wedding is tomorrow.
Today the bride says good-bye to her friends.
Want to go?
Yes, of course.
We must buy a gift.
You must go on your own.
I'm not allowed in.
Come on.
Come in.
This is your house, ma'am.
I know it smells of spices.
That offends the educated western sense of smell.
But what can I do?
I'm Turkish.
This is what smells.
That's how I live!
I'm alone.
You were alone.
If you go up on the roof, there's a wonderful view.
I don't want to go up on the roof.
I'm not alone anymore.
I'm not alone anymore.
More.
Sign here.
Right, that's all in order.
Good-bye.
Thanks.
So long.
Good morning.
Hello.
I would like information on how to get a residence visa.
How long are you staying in Turkey?
Indefinitely.
- And your occupation?
- I'm a housewife.
And your husband?
He's in Spain.
I'm living with a Turk.
There's no problem renewing your passport but to live here you need a residence certificate.
Check with your Turkish friends but in theory you need a justifiable occupation here.
Want a lift?
- I'm going a long way.
- No matter.
I think he said we've to be at the airport before 5.00 but I'm not sure.
Do you speak Turkish?
I should make an effort.
It's a big effort, believe me.
You've been very kind.
Thank you.
Hey!
What do I call you?
I'm sorry, Desideria makes it difficult to tell you something in confidence.
Friends call me Desi.
All right, Desi.
If you need anything, I'm at the Consul in the mornings.
What could I need?
You live in Turkey with a Turk, and in this neighborhood.
I think you're going to need something.
- I hope you're wrong.
- So do I.
I'm Paulina Orozco.
You're wrong, Paulina Orozco.
I won't need you.
I can accept this other life because I have a god.
A god to adore.
And every day, every night, he gives me a piece of heaven.
What's is this?
Have you gone crazy?
Why are you dressed like that?
I want my master to come into me.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you more than I can ever express.
That's enough.
Stop it!
I want to make love with you naturally and happily not as if it were a tragedy!
Not like this.
You're over-excited.
I can't handle it.
Come here.
Please.
I love you, I love you.
I love you, I love you, I'll do anything you ask.
Me, mama of Yaman.
Son, daughter.
You?
Me?
Me, Yaman's whore.
I don't understand a word.
Your mother?
Yes.
These are my children.
I thought she might be your wife.
Careful.
She's my mother.
Now I find out you have a wife and two children.
You could have guessed.
What am I doing in Istanbul?
I don't speak the language, I'm living beside a cemetery waiting for a lover who is another woman's legal husband!
I am separated, legally separated.
When I began to love you I already had a family.
You kept it very quiet.
I have to have them a few weekends!
What's wrong?
What do you want?
You're burning up.
Are there any aspirins here?
They're horrible.
A woman lived here before.
Not Yaman's wife.
Are you jealous?
Hello, I'm back.
Your lover is back.
What's this?
Three hairpins.
Whose are they?
I found them here.
I never said you were my first woman.
But I want to be the last!
This isn't the best way to do it.
Have they eaten?
Yes, they've had dinner.
And an aspirin and a lullaby so they'd sleep.
- I'm going to go mad!
- Calm down.
Calm down.
Calm down.
Calm down.
Go and meet him.
I said to be nice to him.
He's very powerful.
How could you?
Why is it so hard for you to oblige him and oblige me?
Don't you even care if that idiot fucks me?
I've misunderstood you or you've misunderstood me.
I understood you perfectly, Desi, and you, me.
Why?
Hello.
Don't pay haulage.
Paulina, it's urgent.
Check it out and I'll call you back.
Yes?
What happened?
Where are you now?
Calm down.
Calm down.
I feel like killing someone.
- Have you got your passport?
- No, it's at home.
Go and get it, then come to the consulate.
- I've got no money.
- Don't worry, I'll sort it out.
So long.
Arturo stayed at the hotel.
That way, you and I can talk.
Oh, Laura!
I'm mortally wounded.
Humiliated, offended.
Come on, Desi, come on.
Stop that nonsense.
He was just a good lay.
You're here now.
You must try to forget.
You've got me.
You've got your friends.
We'll help you.
I'll ring Arturo.
We've arrived.
Yes.
I warn you, Desi.
Don't tell me I've changed, I know I have.
I've changed.
Marriage is very serious.
I must tell you that.
I'm not married to Ramiro, I'm married to Yaman.
I can't deny the obvious.
That you'll spend your life dying of love for the Turk.
What if I do?
- Hello, Desi.
- How are you, Arturo?
Arturo and I could be intermediaries.
All may not be lost with Ramiro.
But you must be willing.
Look, I will never be me without Yaman!
What does that Turk have?
He's got eyes like this.
And other things you can imagine.
Other things I dream about every night.
That's me, I'm a slut.
I shout like an animal when I'm fucked.
And now please, leave me alone.
Leave me alone.
I want to rest for a while.
You're crazy, Desi.
- What's it to be?
- An orgeat, please
Coming up.
- What can I get you?
- I'll have beer.
Anything else?
- I'll have tonic.
- Lemonade for me.
Bored?
I'm contemplating.
That isn't yes or no.
Will you join us?
I'm fine here.
I'm Ivan.
And you?
Desideria.
Desiree?
Desideria.
But call me Desi.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
Where are you going to?
- Or coming from?
- Now, from Istanbul.
Why were you there?
I'm married to a Turk.
Really?
To a Turk?
Well, it's been a pleasure.
I'd like to hear more about him but...
- Don't go.
Why?
I'm not on the game.
That's obvious.
Are you leaving?
Forgive me.
Why?
I had to know how a man who wasn't Yaman would make love to me.
The Turk?
And now I know.
- It was very nice but...
- But?
A few hours after we met, I'm a whore.
A whore tied for life to her pimp.
Where were you?
In Madrid.
What should I do with you?
I've come back.
You can kill me if you want.
I should throw you out, put you in the street.
Put cold water on your face.
Do you love me?
I just can't decide.
Don't hurry.
Take your time.
- When are you leaving?
- On Tuesday.
Well, let's see.
To begin with I think you should eliminate a few of them the ones that you like least.
But don't hurry.
Can I come in now?
Yes, come in.
Definitely not that tie.
No, I'm all dressed up.
So what?
So what?
A kiss...
A kiss...
A kiss in Spain is a sign of love.
It can never lie.
Thank you.
The Virgin of the Pillar says that she doesn't want to be French.
She wants to be the captain of the Aragonese troops.
Translate.
The Virgin of the Pillar wants to be, not French but captain of the Aragonese troops.
In France, we have enough virgins like that.
In France, we have a lot of virgins.
If all Frenchmen are like you, there won't be that many.
If all Frenchmen are like you, that would surprise her.
But my kiss of love isn't for just anyone.
A kiss...
A kiss...
Fuck, stop kicking my foot.
Am I not doing it right?
It's getting late for Yaman.
He gets up early to open his lovely shop in the bazaar.
We'll leave when you want.
You're not taking Desi.
She's the queen of the evening.
The queen of the evening!
I beg you to stay and enjoy the evening with the very same ease as I leave you with.
I will tell Alain, my secretary to visit you tomorrow at the bazaar.
I'm sure we'll reach an agreement.
Could you take Blanche and Alain to their hotel?
With pleasure.
The Turks are very pleasant.
Don't think I work in such conditions with just anybody.
Don't think I cheat on Yaman with just anybody.
- Yaman...
- Where are you?
At Paulina's place.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
I'm looking at her.
- Why didn't you call before?
- I wasn't sure you'd be there.
Come soon.
I love you.
I love you too.
What's all this?
A gift.
Shouldn't I accept it?
Come.
Take it off.
Don't you like it?
Of course I do.
Are you going to hit me?
What is it with you?
You never understand.
Come.
I want you to know who fucks you best.
You must do me another favor.
A very big favor.
Yes.
Yes.
I'm sure you can help me.
All right?
Give him this envelope.
Will I speak bad French, or bad Spanish?
I can understand French.
There is money missing.
- Miss or Mrs.?
- Miss.
Lots of dollars.
I don't know if Yamin...
Is that his name?
No, Yaman.
...knows the risks.
He's been playing with fire.
My organization doesn't like lies or swindles.
Will you have to make up what is missing?
I think you don't know everything that bastard does.
Is he your friend?
Your lover?
Do you know him well?
He's my lover.
And he's a very good lover.
Let me explain.
He does business with us.
Your good lover is very clever.
Very clever.
Too clever.
But sometimes he thinks we're fools.
Want a snort?
No, thank you.
Well.
As I was saying...
He's very clever.
He exports his best carpets soaked with that white powder which you have just refused.
And how did he get so clever?
He arranges it so that some carpets not all, just the odd one, so that we don't notice get lost en route.
Do you understand?
That's it.
Are you comfortable?
I hope your erotic tastes aren't dreadful.
Don't worry.
I am humble.
Let's see.
Get dressed.
You're very pretty.
I like you very much.
Provided you don't give it to your pimp choose a gift.
Mademoiselle has found a hidden treasure.
If you like it, take it.
Wait.
It's called Desire.
It belonged to a beautiful lady.
You're taking one of my dearest heirlooms.
Please.
A pistol without bullets is of no use.
They are very small bullets.
If you ever want to use it on your Yaman fire at close range right at his head.
Open up.
Don't go in there.
What's wrong?
If I ever kill Yaman, I'll marry you.
Look, my friends.
Reinforcements.
Shit!
I wasn't expecting you until tonight, or tomorrow.
Why give to others what only I deserve?
Kiss me.
Hurry up, Alain.
Got a cigarette?
Yaman.
See you at Ali Pacha's cafe.
- We're all going.
- I'm meeting Denis at six o'clock.
Now I'll see if you really love me.
This isn't a funeral, Desi.
It's a party, a celebration.
What's wrong?
Can't you see I want to be alone with you?
Love is like trade.
A good lover must fulfill two obligations.
First, never lose, keep what you have.
Second, never stake everything on one card.
You mustn't risk love in its entirety.
You must keep some reserves, just in case.
If you don't do that, you become the other person's slave.
And believe me, the other person becomes sick of his slave.
How long have you known that whore?
I want you to drink let yourself go, live and let live.
Love is a game which brightens our lives.
To really do that, its caresses must last.
It must pervade everything, just as a perfume does.
Beneath that silk, you both have breasts which are swelling hearts which are racing, breathing which is agitated contractions which you are beginning to feel somewhere.
Love is always there to be discovered especially with more than two.
Behind the knees a groin, the smoothness of an inner thigh the smoothness of the phallus a curl of hair, armpits, cheekbones, lips.
You see?
Blanche responds even knowing I don't love her.
Why not ask her what she does to understand life?
Why are you so serious?
I don't want to steal your husband.
It's just a game.
How long have you been sleeping with this bitch?
You're unbearable, Desi, darling.
With or without your help I'm going to ride that bitch tonight.
Go away, and let this be the last time I see you.
We must leave discreetly.
You must take me to a friend's house.
She has to get away.
She has to get away.
Desi has to get away.
Get a doctor!
Good-bye, my desires.
Good-bye, children I can never have.
Good-bye, friends I didn't love.
Good-bye, lovers who denied me friendship.
Everything is over.
I don't know in which world I belong.
It all comes down to the same.
A humming which, from now on will mark my hours of solitude.
It will be sweet to die from this memory although I don't know

- An eclair, an eclair, an eclar with a whipped cream!
- Wonderfully will decorate the wreaths candy...
- The master piece!
- How is it possible he had the key from this yard when you don't know him?
- Maybe he repaired something here?
- because he's a plumber.
- he always tries to repair something in our house and it is never working!
- But Herminka likes him.
- Don't you know our niece Herminka?
- Yes, yes.
- Well, she asked him to paint our fence, and he stepped into our hydrangea.
CLOSED
I AM IN THE STOREHOUSE
- Mrs. Horackova, I need to go to the storehouse.
- I only need a little thing.
- Come in.
You'll wait in my store until I get back.
- Alright.
- Hello, do you have American cigarettes?
- I don't sell those cigarettes.

- Thank you, have a nice day.
- I will smoke a little cigarette.
- A lot of fume I will breathe out.
- and then one or the other aunt...
- ...in my arms I will hold.
- Bobina!
- BOBINA!
- His father once picked up the money for a raffle...
- ...and the police caught him because he tried to hide the money in his coat.
Then his wife spreaded out that he wanted to commit a suicide.
- so they didn't report it.
But they young man!
Oh!
- You can give me the money, Miss.

One moment.
- What... what do you want from me?
!
- Stop!
Give me my money!

They killed Mrs. cashier!

- Bobina!
- Bobina...
- Look Bobina!
- isn't he handsome?
- oh that's you!
- you saved our life!
- Really?
Thank you.
- We were looking for you for so long!
- Seriously?
- you don't tell me that...
- You were in the drugstore and have read it, huh?
- I started reading, but didn't finish it.
- I have written it.
- Congratulations.
That's great.
- What do you think?
- will we get together?
- What?
- you and me?
- sure, when and how?
- It won't be that quick.
First I need to go to get my sister in the savings bank.
- Yes, ok!
Wait!
In the savings bank?
!
- Yeah.
- You have sister in the savings bank...
- Fanny will be excited!
- She sure will.
- But don't say it to Herminka, it is a secret.
- wait here for me.
- I will make sure to wait here.
- of course, you can count on me.
- Excuse me, thank you.
- Excuse me please.
Thanks.
- Where are you going?
- Is my sister inside?
- Where?
- In the savings bank.
- She is in there.
- I need to talk to her.
- you can't go inside.
- Mr. chief, mr. chief!
- Don't you know about anything?
They robbed the savings bank!
- That's impossible!
- Mr. chief, please!
Come with me.
- Why?
- Fanny is really hurt!
- they don't want to let me go inside.
Please Mr. chief...
- Ok then, come on.
- In the savings bank was saved 149 131 Czech crowns in total.
- That young generation!
- he has 150 000 in here and he fights me because of a few crowns!
- he should have taken the money and leave!
- he didn't have to shoot at Mrs. Svatonova!
- It looks like someone local robbed the bank.
- I would recognize local person, but I've never seen this man before.
- There could be more of them.
- I didn't see more of them.
- ask the young policeman who looks after the beer in front of that pub!
if he looked after the bank, he could have caught the robber!
- The robber had a weapon?
- we haven't found any signs of shooting, Mrs. Toufarova.
- I am not married.
- Pardon?
- I am not a Mistress.
I have no right to use that prefix.
- I am sorry.
- Bastard!
- He had something to slam us with!
- He is here.
- 1 000 crowns is gone!
Will the bank give it back to me?
!
- Be calm!
It will all be explained.
- Poor Andelka, she will be mad at me.
I need to go find her!
- Mrs. ...
Miss Toufarova, you need to wait here!
- Andelka!
- you were right!
We should save the money yesterday!
- You can't be here.
- What happened?
- Can I step inside too?
I am standing in plum jam here.
- Sure!
Please make place here.
- This lady needs to stay here, and others need to go away!
- Where is the robber?
- He is gone.
- Oh no.
- He made up more work for us.
- Where's Mrs. cashier?
- They drove her to hospital, the robber slammed her into head.
- Yet, she is unable to testify.
- That means we don't have any witnesses, right?
- We do, comrade captain.
- Frantiska Toufarova, born 4/17/1903, unmarried.
- The bastard came in from behind.
- he had a good plan!
- because he had something over his head!
- but he didn't know I will be there with Mrs. Svatonova.
- I was hiding under the counter.
- I started to fight him when he shooted at her!
- I was lucky, because this young policeman helped me to move the plums into the entrance.
- the robber probably slipped on them!
- The old woman robbed the bank herself.
- Not the policeman slipped, but the robber!
- he didn't have time to shoot at me!
- as he was falling, he took me down with him.
Like this!
- Mistress, please!
- He probably fell on me, because I fainted.
- when I got away from him, he didn't have the cloth on face anymore.
- he got scared, and ran away!
- I would have caught him for sure!
- but you put the plums into the entrance like left handed.
- Hello Miss Toufarova, my name is Jedlicka, I am captain of criminal department.
- can you please show it to us inside?
- Sure.
I am here for you.
- Thank you.
- Who are you?
- I am her sister, Mrs. Horackova.
- Nice to meet you.
- This is your brother?
- No, that's our friend.
- Mr. chief of the drugstore.
- Ok.
- Mr. chief, please take care of Mrs., ...are you Mistress?
- Yes, I am widow.
- Take care of Mrs. Horackova.
- Sure.
- The plums in the entrance were really badly put.
- Ms. Toufarova...
- Yes?
- Please sit down.
- Would you recognize the robber?
- Of course.
- Can you describe him?
- Bastard!
Criminal type at first sight.
- Pack!
- We are packing, going home!
- before they catch me!
Please!
- Who?
!
- Aunts.
Aunts, aunts, aunts!
- I know why you haven't shown me to them.
- Polar bears can't be seen from short distance either!
- Michal what is up?
- They are tricksters!
- You said they are cutely nutty...
- that they are a little odd.
- Yes!
- They look like they just left the mental hospital!
- Wait please, someone told you some rumors.
- What?
!
Nobody did, my knees are shivering from what I've experienced!
- one aunt tried to throttle me and wanted money from me.
- another aunt wanted to date me in front of tobacco shop in public!
- I'm leaving.
I am!
- farewell, paradise of flowers!
- my dreamt of paradise.
- Michal!
Michal!
- Michal, can you finally tell me what happened?
!
- It's a shame I couldn't show him to you
- such a polite man, you don't see many of them
- handsome man, with good behavior and with a car
- even the dog looked very nice
- Bobina saw him through a window
- They sure will get the money from the bastard back.
- he can't escape.
- that is his fate.
- I have a number of the car of the man!
- I could have asked the captain whether I need to stay over night or no.
- He sure will come back!
- especially when he saw I am very interested!
- Andelka, I don't want to hurt you...
- but I have different concerns right now.
- are you aware of how big responsibility do I have now?
- But why did you try to escape?
- you could have explained it.
- I couldn't Herminka, I couldn't.
- she has beaten me.
- I can't make a fool of myself in public, especially when I have a day off at work because of my gall bladder attack.
- there was a chance I would be embarassed in front of the whole district.
- Michal, that's impossible.
- You just got into a misunderstanding with your recklessness.
- Well, I was reckless, that's true.
- I always believed I will marry an old, ugly and lonely girl.
- I've recklessly kept my word.
- you will never be lonely, you won't!
- Aunts, aunts are everlasting!
- about those two, Goethe wrote stories...
- Michal, you are very upset...
- ...you probably caused something terrible, but I am not mad at you.
- Oh yeah.
- Now, if you love me, take your car, drive to the forest and stay there until I come to get you.
- I will make this work.
- Be quick, the aunts are almost here!
- Where is the forest?
!
- There, there!
- Where is the deepest forest?
- There!
- Ok, bye.
- Bye bye!
- Herminka!
- how come you are here today?
- it worked for me.
- Great you are here my girl.
- What is up?
- I've found a he-dog.
- Dear Herminka!
- For Bobina!
- Dear Herminka.
- your aunt is born for the second time, I was almost dead.
- They robbed the savings bank.
- they almost killed Mrs. cashier.
- and our Fanny caught the robber.
- I held him like this!
He escaped, but the police will get him.
- I can't be held up here anymore, the criminal police will come get me soon and we will go to the town.
- I am a royal witness.
- With all my bad luck...
- it is possible that I made some mistakes...
- even if the aunt is crazy, I will behave like a soulful person...
- that won't make the jackall people hunt me for the rest of my life.
- What are you looking at?
That's a fact!
- Dear aunt.
- I know you've had a hard life.
- you've never got to know...
- safe wave of a family happiness...
- that's what made you...
- to naturally hate all men.
- because men are rabble.
- Dear aunt...
- I am someone, who come to you...
- to make it all up to you.
- That's good huh?
- come on!
- Can I offer you a little of our jam?
We made it together with Herminka.
- our Herminka is still single...
- she doesn't need to rush with marriage.
- you know, such a beautiful girl can always pick from lots of men.
- she's the only daughter of our deceased sister.
- she will inherit all that you see here from us.
- Is it possible to find the robber even though you don't know anything about him?
- Not possible, but it is necessary.
- Mrs. Horackova, where were you during the robbery?
- In the drugstore.
Mr. chief can testify that.
- That's the man whom you were in front of the bank with?
- Yes, we got there after the robbery, everyone has seen that!
- I am ready to go.
- Do you want wine from our Herminka?
- No thanks, I am at work.
- I already took some for captain.
- Ms. Toufarova, that wasn't necessary.
- That's from the nice us.
- There?
- Go, go.
- Thank you.
- Get in.
- Goodbye Herminka.
- Fanny, please be careful!
- Do you have tissue with you?
- Goodbye, Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Finally we have time to talk.
- No, no.
I only came for a little bit, I need to go back to work.
- Then you could go with them...
- But I didn't want to make it harder for aunt Fanny.
- Our Herminka can excellently pickle cabbage and pickles.
- are you married Mrs. captain?
- No.
- Andelka's guess was right!
- Did she give you the numbers?
- What numbers?
- I knew she would forget it.
- Remind me the next time.
- you could catch the robber according to the numbers.
- once I've read that they caught the whole group of robbers thanks to numbers of banknotes.
- Do you have numbers of the banknotes you put into the savings bank today?
- I always write them down.
- Are we going back?
- that's a pity.
- I kiss you all happily my aunts...
- and because of you...
- I will get the mark that I am yours...
- or I will...
- for my money...
- esthetically wallpaper myself...
- and mainly stop singing.
- Michal!
- What are you doing here?
I am looking for you in the forest.
- Look, I have forgiven aunts their sins.
- No!
- What are you doing?
!
- Lay down!
- No!
I don't want to!
- You have to!
- The criminal police is looking for you.
- Why?
- Besides the aunt there was an empty cash box and shooted mrs. cashier.
- Remember what have you read?
- F. L. Vek, but I've looked through that book.
- Wouldn't your dog eat it?
- are you looking after him?
!
- It depends what did you write the numbers on.
- Not on a sausage.
- I will lose everything...
- Fanny won't give me anything because of that.
- You know Mr. captain...
- Andelka will even lose things I never give to her.
- Ms. Toufarova, did you light up the stove today?
- We use fuel for heating...
- Why didn't you explain it to the captain?
- Aunt Fanny was explaining it so trustworthily.
- and she haven't seen anyone but you...
- What does that mean?
- Misa, please calm down.
- The aunt said they don't have any fingerprints, which means they don't even have yours.
- you didn't leave any tracks after you, so nothing can happen to you.
- they will catch the one that robbed the bank!
- Because of what?
- The captain said they always catch him.
- Because of what?
!
- Not because of your look!
- The aunt could never describe how you look...
- What?
!
- You think you are beautiful!
- Mr. captain, he looked like this...
- he grinned so weirdly...
- and he had the eyes of a robber...
- this is nonsense, he didn't have the eye below the ear, he had it normally in his face.
- Yes, and he had the hair of a robber...
- no, he wasn't this handsome...
- on the first sight, he looked like a robber...
- well, this is better...
- his mouth was grinning...
- ...and nose like a bobble.
- yes, this is starting to be more similar!
- his chin was kind of long...
- ears like fly-flaps...
- and hair... simply like a nerd...
- messy hair...
- all over his head...
- yes!
That's him.
- You have a great imagination, I would really like to find this person.
- What will we say to Mr. captain about that you can't find the numbers of the banknotes?
- he will be here in a minute.
- I was looking for them yesterday.
Today I am looking for a number of the car.
- That's your only one concern!
- You think about dogs, while we are solving human life and our money!
- That likeable lover of animals of yours could have been the robber!
- But Fanny, you've described him like a monster and this guy was a good-looker.
- Your imaginations of beauty, I knew your man...
- Lojzicku, did you hear it?
- you didn't deserve this.
- What is up Ms. Toufarova?
- Andelka keeps thinking about the dog, we have real concerns here and she said she saw a smilar dog to Bobina yesterday.
- I understand it, I like dogs as well.
- She saw him after the robbery with a man, behind the savings bank, and I said it could have been the robber and she got all upset and left.
- Are we going back again?
- Something fell off...
- Those are the numbers of the banknotes that Andelka lost...
- Let me see.
- Bobina, where is your mistress?
- where is your mistress Bobina?
- So Mrs. Horackova says this dog looked the same like the dog in the car...
- Yes, she is looking for the same dog...
- she says it is a rare breed that is unknown yet.
- You are going on a trip, Bobina.
- Its back is like a back of a Spitz.
- ears like ears of a Schnauzer.
- and colour, something in between a Setter and a long-haired Dachshund.
- Tail of a Czech Pointer.
- eye of a thrush.
- That's not a description, that's a breed muddle.
- Let go!
...what about size?
- height.
- This is useless.
Call an expert.
- Hello.
- How did you find me?
- I am already married, with her.
- Hi my aunt...
- My children!
That's a happiness!
- You tell me about that...
- Fanny will be excited!
- Herminka!
- You aren't a kid anymore...
- I think we shouldn't tell this to Fanny yet, you know how principled she can be when it comes to ethics.
- How about that?
!
Fanny doesn't understand this, she doesn't know what a man is!
- Yeah, and what if she doesn't like Michal?
- Oh!
I would make this work!
Michal...
- Misa...
- so they call you Misa...
- he is handsome!
- I've told Fanny that I already liked you when we first met by the church and I didn't even know you are ours!
- Well Herminka, I need to touch him some...
- Fanny is so confused being a royal witness, she said Misa could be the robber!
- Well, exactly.
- Exactly.
- Oh my, she can make it complicated.
- Savings bank, the robbery, Misa with car, escaped...
- she can even report it!
- my children, I am going, I need to watch her.
- Well...
- this is purebred mutt.
- Give me photos and look for this dog.
- Welcome home.
- you leave the house, won't tell it to anyone and everything falls on me.
- What falls on you?
- I am looking for the number of the yellow car.
- That's nice of you, but I don't need it anymore...
- But the police needs it!
- Why is that?
- Because that handsome man of yours is an accomplice of the robber!
- How do they know that?
- I told them!
- Bobina is already arrested!
And according to her they will look for the dog in the car!
- Fanny, you shouldn't have done this...
- the man has nothing to do with it...
- the man is...
- a bridegroom of our Herminka.
- The dog is probably made-up.
- Hello, is this your dog?
- Yes, he has a muzzle, he is on a leash and here is a bag of...
- That's alright, we are looking for a smaller dog, see...
- ears, tail, totally different.
- Did you lose a dog?
- It is clear, the robber is someone else than the man in the car.
- I already thought so, because you described him so nicely.
- Do you think Herminka will be happy with him?
- You would need to see him...
- So Herminka doesn't need us anymore...
- Now we are free.
- We will just look at them, and we will be happy.
- What if they find Misa according to his dog?
!
- We need to warn him right now!
- that dog needs to disappear.
- My little native cottage, white lily of the valley, please fulfill my silly wish...
- I want to be a snow flake...
- One coffee with water soda...
- To fly to you through a blue sky...
- You can hardly stand...
- Like a mouse enter your dreams...
- I want to have a cat and an alarm clock...
- Only for you my love, only for you my love, my heart is in chest is suffocating...
- I want to be a lace on your scarf...
- If I were a clothes moth I would become a lover...
- I will walk on a path to your house...
- Holes I would flood with asphalt...
- For you I will be a rose...
- Gardening scissors I like so much...
- That all only for you my love, only for you my love to let you dream about me...
- Andelka, such a polite woman doesn't take off anything in a wine bar, not even a hat.
- Miss, where can we find Mrs. accountant Sklenarova?
- I don't know, grandpa.
- Twice red wine, twice white wine...
- Do you need a pill?
- That would make an addict of me.
- I want to play with breeze...
- Then there will be a gale...
- Glass of wine and five lemonades...
- For that there's a rhyme - the chicken...
- I want to be a white cloud...
- I want to vaporize as well...
- Only for you my love, only for you my love to dream about me...
- ...to dream about me...
- to dream about me.
- There he is.
- What's happening over here?
- MURDERER!
- Misa!
- Misa, Misanek...
- Help me...
Misa?
- Good, thank you.
- Tell the aunts hi from me.
- Sure.
- Don't worry aunt, Misa says hi.
- Thank you.
- What?
- Andelka, I shouldn't have brought the plums to the savings bank.
- Make a place here please.
- Move.
- What are you looking at?
Move on.
- Here we go.
- Misa?
- Herminka, this is the end.
- I won't recover that quickly from this.
- You don't need to give me warm clothes.
- In the jail, the have heating nowadays.
- Misa don't be crazy, you have clear conscience, don't you?
- I do, but it is not a question of psychological inquiry.
We need to know who robbed the bank.
- And now they think I've done it.
- They think I've done it!
- Misa!
- Don't worry, and now...
- They think I've done it.
- Take a biscuit.
- Thank you.
- They think I've done it.
- Misa please don't worry, the aunts are with us.
- Really?
- One aunt saw me stealing money from her in the savings bank.
- second aunt saw me escaping with the money.
- Here, drink the tea.
- Chamomile tea.
- Thank you.
- Better?
- At first, I've shooted Mrs. cashier...
- secondly I've shooted the aunt...
- then I've spreaded the plums all over the place...
- Finally I was lucky enough to robber the bank.
- But... where is the 150 000 Czech crowns?
- Where is the 150 000?
!
- Where should it be?
- Where is the 150 000?
!
- Misa, the money are somewhere here!
- Where is the 150 000!
I would like to know where is the 150 000 and 20...
- Misa, you will break our cactus.
- ...penny's.
- 20 penny's.
- What?
- 20 penny's
- 20 penny's.
- 150 000
- 20 penny's!
- Gate to the yard...
- the pub was closed
- the plums were here...
- maybe the policeman robbed the bank, because no one has reported him
- Good morning.
- I am putting back one witness...
- we don't need her anymore
- can I come in?
- Mrs. Horackova, did you find the number of the car?
- I've looked through everything, but I am so left handed, I think I lost it
- Please sit down Mr. captain
- Thanks.
- That's a pity.
- How would you describe the man?
- Well, more like a shabby man.
- but very attractive man...
- He had a moustache, I know that for sure!
- What car does he have?
- Yellow one, but I don't know which brand...
- our neighbor Tomecek has a yellow car too
- and I don't even recognize if it's ours or someone else's...
- That is alright.
- Thank you.
- Are you mad at us?
- We don't even keep you here, we are too busy...
- That's alright.
I'll come later.
- Do you think I've played it well?
- Doesn't matter.
- I know who robbed the bank.
- Who?
- Tomecek.
- Seek, seek!
Where is your master, huh?
- Come on, seek!
Where does your master live?
Go, go!
- Come in.
- Hello miss.
- Mrs. Tomecek, you were in the savings bank last night.
You had keys from the yard.
- you left the door open, me and God have seen you!
- you couldn't resist the temptation of sin.
- Miss, I've always known you two are crazy.
- I was only playing I didn't see it because of your niece!
- Don't you hide behind Herminka!
- With so much money you can't hide, make us a favor, give back the gun and confess.
- Don't let people suffer because of you!
- You crazy old woman!
- If you tell anyone you've seen me there I will tear you to pieces!
You won't live till the next morning!
Now get out!
- Now you came out!
- Get out!
- That won't fit in there.
- What?
!
- It won't fit.
- Why are you whispering?
- Maybe it was bad idea to want him to confess.
- If the police asked him, he would never tell them the truth.
This way he won't be able to hold it anymore!
- We'll see.
- Fuel please.
- Alright Mrs. Horackova!
- Pour petrol instead of diesel in it!
So they explode.
- What's up?
- Didn't you get along with them?
- I have no idea what's up.
- You can't be so sad over that you didn't find the he-dog yet.
- There are worse things to solve.
- Oh, robber?
Did they catch him yet?
- That man wasn't the robber, they've explained it.
- Oh, who was it then?
- Local person, Fanny recognized him.
- What did police say?
- Fanny doesn't want to tell it to anyone, she thinks he ought to confess on his own.
- Please don't tell anybody I've told you this.
- I won't.
- Give me a poison for rats!
- If I only knew whether the beast want's a coke or it has its master somewhere around here.
- Is this your dog?
- What?
- My dog?
I've never seen this dog.
- Well...
- He's mine.
- Ok.
- Show me your ID.
- Ok.
- I need to fine you.
- the dog doesn't have a leash, tag and a....
- muzzle.
- How much?
- CB-55-23
- CB-55-23
- You prepared really well for me Mrs. Horackova.
- I thought that someone wants to rob our house, I've heard a car...
- Which car?
- What do you mean?
- Mr. captain, come inside, we are waiting for you.
- Do you see me mr. captain?
- they almost murdered me.
- What!
- Murdered.
- How come?
!
- Look what he's done to me.
- Who?
!
- The robber.
- Tomecek drove Fanny over today.
- Why do you think Tomecek is the robber?
- Because he said it himself!
- Fanny has seen him before the robbery happened.
- he just got out of yard of the savings bank and he had keys.
- And when I went to tell him to confess, he said he will murder me if I tell you a word about it.
- Today he was looking after us, swearing and then he drove Fanny over.
- Miss, did you recognize Tomecek in the car?
- No, but I recognized the car of Tomecek's!
- They call you.
- What happened?
- Criminal police is here.
- Damned old women.
- Play for me.
- I am sorry if I disturb you, I am captain Jedlicka.
- We only need some information from you, please sit down.
- Where did you go by your car today afternoon?
- I don't have a car.
- You don't have any car?
- I sold my car one month ago.
- I have the confirmation here somewhere.
- No no, don't look for it.
It's ok.
- You don't use the car anymore at all?
- No, not at all.
- Look, Mr. Tomecek...
- Just to make it clear, were you in the savings bank when the robbery happened?
- What would I do there?
!
- That's what I am asking you.
- That's nonsense!
- I've never been on yard of the savings bank.
- I never knew it was the yard of the savings bank...
- but we have information about you being on the yard
- She's a sclerotic old woman!
- she doesn't remember what happened one hour ago...
- but that I was on the yard during the robbery, she's bound to know?
!
- Well even if Miss Toufarova is mistaken...
- I still don't understand why did you threaten her you would murder her if she told us about this.
- She could make a total loser of me
- How?
- She says I robbed the savings bank
- You can't be mad at her for this, she's noticed you had keys from the yard
- Tell me what did you have the keys for?
- That's alright, he was with my wife
- that yard is common and I was at work for the whole night that day.
- so he has alibi
- he is innocent.
- So, Mr. Tomecek is innocent, he was on the yard because he had some personal affairs.
- Woman!
- Innkeeper?
- No, she's married!
- Well...
- it is not nice.
- That is starting to be complicated.
- I know.
Is this the man you've seen?
- No.
- No.
- Fanny said he looked like a bastard.
- And this is handsome man.
- But not as handsome as the one Mrs. Horackova saw, right?
- Yeah.
- By the way...
Mr. chief has seen the man with the dog as well?
- No, Mr. chief was in the storehouse
- I went to get him after they refused to let me meet Fanny.
- It is not easy to cooperate with you.
- Hello Mrs. Horackova.
Still nothing about the dog.
- Thank you Mr. chief!
I will come to your store in a bit.
- Why are you talking to her?
She made me look like an idiot.
- If I didn't sell my car, I would be prime suspect.
- Misa needs to hide somewhere!
The police has a photo of him.
- what?
- P-O-L-I-C-E
- I don't have time to explain this to you now...
- Fanny got knocked down by a yellow car with the murderer in it.
- and the police is so incapable, they want to mark Michal as the robber.
- That is my gall bladder.
- Gall bladder!
- my nerves!
- that's because I don't eat anything!
- Don't try to deceive me.
What did you do yesterday afternoon?
!
- I was scared, here, with the door locked, under my covers.
- Stop lying!
You wanted to drive the aunt over!
- and you know why!
- No!
- You will pack your teeth brush, pyjamas...
- and you will either move to a cave in the forest, or you will report yourself!
- I want this to be finally over!
- I have my pyjamas!
- Then you can go!
- I am going!
- Don't try to think that I will wait for you until you get back from jail.
- I am not trying to think so.
- Where am I going?
- when the police is chasing after me...
- where am I going?
- Down there to the aunts
- the guns are barking there...
- and the desperate men are lost there...
- and from the hands of the aunts, only few people return...
- down there where the aunts live...
- a quiet jail is waiting for me...
- and where the cakes are made...
- the aunts will chase after me again...
- when I will have the goal...
- to become an aunt...
- down there where the aunts live...
- that's my final destination.
- Misa!
- That's so kind of you that you are here!
- Herminka is crazy.
- It is probably a hereditary taint.
- Aunts, you are the only two wise human beings, where can I go to.
- That was an amazing idea of Herminka's!
- Give me a kiss.
- If it's necessary, you'll hide in the shed.
- More, more kisses...
- We will bring food in there for you!
- Oh, a tree.
- Misa!
Look out.
- We will also bring food for this little dog.
- Everything will be fine!
- Just don't stand by the windows.
- You don't have to care about your car, everything will be fine.
- we will hide it behind the shed.
- It won't even be necessary!
- I've written down the numbers of the car that drove me over.
- Fanny, I admire you.
- CB-30-01, what will we do?
!
- God, what will we do?
!
- Lock him.
- Misanek, you can turn the heater on.
- if you are cold, there is diesel heating.
- Stay there.
- We got him.
- Now what?
I AM IN THE STOREHOUSE
- He is probably on the yard.
- I will tell you who robbed the savings bank.
- Who?
- Those two old women.
- The yellow car is parked behind their shed.
- I knew that.
- Take the car and quickly drive away, some people here are alergic for yellow cars.
- You said it is the best colour.
- Sometimes, not right now.
- Can I keep it at home?
- It is yours.
- Wilda...
- Mr. chief, what are we supposed to do?
You are the only ingelligent man we can trust.
- I'll be right back at the drugstore.
- Look, here's a yellow car.
- Don't confuse it.
- Mr. chief, we caught the robber, right now.
- Here's the number of his car.
- Can you imagine, how terrible it is...
- he is a member of our family.
- How is this possible?
CB-55-23...
- Why is this car here?
- Hand me that paper.
- No!
- Give me that paper!
- I won't!
- Give me that.
- No.
- Mr. chief, what are you doing?
- I am telling you to give it to me!
- Mr. chief!
- For the robbery you will get around 6 years...
- but for double homicide you will get a death penalty
- you either have read bad detective stories, or your nerves are not fine.
- That robbed had the same shoes like Mr. chief...
- Mr. captain, we have another robber at home in the shed...
- with a yellow car.
- That is a fiance of your niece, isn't he?
- I just don't understand that the number of his car is the same like the number on the paper...
- Fanny, that second number was of the car with the man, when we didn't know it was our Misa yet.
- The first number is a number of the yellow car that Tomecek sold to a miss of Mr. chief.
- I always confuse everything...
- It is alright Mrs. Horackova.
- You know...
- the worst thing was, you gave Mr. chief awesome alibi.
- But I was in the drugstore during the robbery.
- With Mr. Chief?
- See?
- He was in the storehouse.
- But still, you've caught the robber.
- Because of his shoes.
- No.
- Because of the numbers of the banknotes
- which Mr. chief handed over with his takings.
- you know, Mrs. Horackova, he wasn't as intelligent, as you might think.
- I've robbed the savings bank...
- drove aunt over...
- set fire on the shed.
- do what you need to do.
- For the first two things we caught someone better.
- How did you do this?
- My aunts...
- I wanted to turn the heating on...
- as I was locked in there...
- and in the jerry can for diesel, was gasoline...
- How is that possible?
- We will ask Mr. chief.
- Don't worry, Misa!
- The most important is, everything is alright, even Mrs. cashier!
- Be happy that you are healthy!
- Misa!
Misa!
- Let me go!
- Don't you worry!
I've decided that I will wait for you until you get back from the jail.
- Nothing really happened.
- We will repair the shed easily now, when we have a man in the house.
- And Bobina will have her bridegroom as well.
- We will do with Fifinka...
- what is in our power.

Menelaus, king of Sparta, departing to visit the court of his brother Agamemnon takes leave of his wife Helen, who was famous for her extraordinary beauty.
Paris, son of the Trojan king, comes to the court of Menelaus and in his absence is greeted by Helen.
The young Trojan has made a deep impression on the beautiful Helen, with his magnificent retinue and the offering of more than royal Oriental treasures, so unknown to the Spartan people.
The loyal slave of Menelaus, who spied on the Queen and Paris when Venus, the goddess of love, covered them with her veil, brings the message to the king of his wife's infidelity.
Carried by the god Zephyrus, representing the soft wind of love in the fable lore, ...Helen is transported to Troy, there to be received with royal honours at Paris' side.
The joint Greek monarchs decide to exterminate Troy, and so avenge the indignity that Paris, the king's son, has inflicted upon one of the bravest Spartan monarch.
While the luxurious daily routine continues during the 10 year siege of Troy, ...a message is brought that another tremendous attack by the besiegers has been beaten off.
end of the first part
THE FALL OF TROY second part
Since the Greeks could not overcome the city by force, it is decided to resort to cunning.
A number of soldiers was hidden in a wooden horse of great proportions and by quick departure of the troops it was made as if the siege has been broken.
The trick has worked.
The Trojans think that the Greeks have fled in a hurry and even left behind the statue dedicated to one of their gods.
The Trojans decide to bring the horse, this idol of the Greeks, ...inside the walls of Troy for the appeasement of their own gods.
The colossal size of the horse makes it necessary that a part of the fortress wall must be torn down, a gap which the Trojans in their flush of victory fail to repair.
Ulysses the brave and cunning Greek, to whose brain occurred the trick, reports that the plan has worked.
The wall has been torn down;
the horse in which the soldiers are hidden, is in the city.
Now continue the attack on Troy.
The Greek soldiers, the living contents of the wooden horse, ...begin their destructive work by setting fire to Troy in several places.
Through the gap that the Trojans had made to bring in the horse, ...now enter the Greek soldiers, and surprise the Trojans, already frightened by the fire.

Moscow, the city of 1,000 bells.
The Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church.
I want...
Want a divorce from my wife.
My wife loves another and I...
I do not want to be an obstacle to their happiness.
A marriage blessed by the Church is sacred and indissoluble!
The law allows divorce in only three cases...
If one spouse does not show any sign of life for 5 years.
If there is a disability in the marriage...
In the case of duly proved adultery!
But keep in mind...
Three beings coexist: my wife and I and a third person...
Among us there is such great tension, the conflict of feelings so painful,
That divorce is the only possible solution!
What should I do?
Each one carries the cross imposed by the Lord!
In a similar case,
What remains to a mere mortal?
The law...
Excuse me...
Do you still want to get a divorce?
It's simple...
Adultery with a police report.
Only a hotel room, three witnesses, and a "lady."
Who are these people?
These are the "witnesses."
Artemjew, "expert in divorce."
Those are the "ladies."
Do you want to be with or without police?
With a policeman, it will be five rubles, but it is safer.
It's disgusting!
Dear Lisa!
Victor Karenin and you are in love.
I do not want to change your life.
You will not see me again.
I free you, and I want to be free, too.
Farewell, be happy.
Fedya.
In the home of the Protassov's.
Sacha's sister Lisa.
Anna Pavlova, Lisa's mother.
Has Fedja arrived?
No!
Karenin.
Chamberlain Victor Karenin.
I got a brief recess from a session...
So I came for a moment.
I came directly from a session...
Then stay for dinner!
Dad, please...
Stop it, Dad.
Do you want to finish?
My name is Petuchkov, nicknamed "the good genie."
What do you want?
I can provide a revolver for a price.
I have no intention of committing suicide.
Why then the farewell letter?
Once again, you have made Lisa cry!
This house has become a living hell!
We avoid each other, we are at our limits.
Where are you going?
Are you pushing Lisa and Karenin into each other's arms?
They love each other.
You must understand me ...
I cannot lie or hide ...
And above all, I do not want to be an obstacle to the happiness of others.
With the gypsies, life is taken more lightly.
I love you.
I do not wish, nor will wish, to change your life.
I shall not return again.
I free you and myself, too.
From Fedor Vassilievitch.
I've always loved Fedja, and I love him now,
But I hate you!
So, you have come here!
It's outrageous!
Get your coat.
Your wife sent me.
I have to say ... she is waiting for you outside.
I pray you to forget everything and return home.
I will not go back on my decision.
He came to convince me to return to my wife.
She is crying.
You should go see her, and return.
Did you say "Must"?
I think otherwise.
Some days later.
What do you want from me?
To make a divorce possible!
So - a hotel room, 3 witnesses, and a "lady"?
We live in a state that has its laws ...
Put yourself in the place of Lisa ...
I am incapable of lying.
I cannot act in this odious comedy.
For Lisa ...
Okay, I will do everything that you ask of me.
The hotel room.
The witnesses.
The police.
The "lady".
Do we really have to go through everything .. down to every detail?
Sure!
We cannot give false testimony.
It's not our style!
This client is very nervous.
An idealist.
I think it is time.
Did you not even taste a little?
Police Report:
The signatories testify under oath that they
have surprised Mr. Fedor Vassilievitch Protassov in the Hotel "The White Angel"
in the company of a lady, being guilty of adultery,
as one of the requirements of paragraph 286 ...
You understand me.
This I cannot do.
Totally impossible!
I cannot even want to lie.
I will not lie!
Go to hell!
If only there were grounds for divorce ...
He will do everything necessary; he has given me his word.
I hate lying and I refuse to act in an odious comedy.
I find it easier to die.
You should get married to be happy.
I am stopping you from getting married, therefore I must die.
When you receive this letter I shall no longer be living.
Don't you want to die?
I would say that you do not need this, right?
Go to hell, damned demon!
Police Report:
A week ago some clothes were found on the banks of the Moscow River as well as documents belonging to Mr. Fedor Vassilievitch Protassov.
A portfolio contained a letter explaining his reasons for suicide.
Three days later, a body was found.
Are you coming to identify the body?
Show this lady the body of Mr. Protassov.
You could open the window, stupid!
We can certify that she recognizes the corpse.
Come quickly ...
My parents will wake up and lock me in!
I cannot go with you.
I'm dead now ...
I'm a drowned man who has already been buried.
A man without documents, an outlaw.
I am a living corpse.
You cannot join me in the life that awaits me.
You must believe me and let me go alone.
How dear he has become since he died.
Everything was so uncertain, and now ... everything is clear.
It is forbidden to sleep here!
Completing her year of mourning,
Mrs. Lisa Protassov, widow of Fedia Vassilievitch Protassov, who died in tragic circumstances, will marry the State Councilor Chamberlain,
In the outskirts of Moscow.
In the slums of Moscow.
Why are you beating that animal?
You'll kill it!
A raid!
A raid!
Those who do not have their documents, get out!
Come, let us go to the cafe.
I have money.
It is absurd; he drowned.
It has been a long time since he died and was buried.
Someone could get some money ...
Since you are alive, and since your wife has remarried ...
We have a fortunate situation on our hands.
Mr. Karenin is very rich.
Blackmail?
Here is a living corpse!
I admire his punctuality.
Always arrive on time, just for dinner.

God, When did you leave me alone?
The law.

THE LAW.
I'll never leave you!
I'll go with you to Siberia!
Who would want such a man?
He is a ridiculous figure!
I am not guilty.
I wanted everything to be better ...
LAW.
When asked ... carry out the identification of the corpse ...
Why did you say you recognized your husband?
I was so convinced ... and so nervous also ...
Your name?
Your name, profession, confession?
How can you ask such dumb things?
You already know!
Three people ... waging a painful moral battle outsiders can never understand!
Only a divorce could clear that tension ...
Freedom!
But you place many obstacles in the way of that freedom!
So I found a way out ... without dying.
An exit that would have been distressing and painful.
I ruined my life.
MY LIFE!
All alive are relieved and happy.
To survive a vile individual, a hustler ...
I have suffered, that is why I'm here.
Do you admit your guilt?
I wonder if he acknowledges his guilt!
The prosecutor.
First, the will of an individual.
Furthermore, the law.
Naturally, the law comes first!
The law is intangible.
The interest of the State requires punishment for a crime.
The defense.
What about the accused?
Is there some trial here with a crime and a criminal?
No, we have before us some unhappy beings.
Who could leave this room illuminated by the sagacity of this judgment.
They have recognized their faults ... and begin a new and happy life.
We must help.
The court retires to deliberate.
What might be the harshest sentence?
Banishment to Siberia, for your wife and for you.
What about the best?
A penance and, of course, the restoration of the marriage.
The jury room.
The judges's chamber.

- While I was praying, I saw Milos Obilic (Serbian mythical warrior)... and he was blessing the child.
Petar, the terrible lion came in my dream and ate me, but Childs voice awoke me.
I want to see that child.
Your son will be great man.
Take good care of him and always remember what I told you.
Years were passing by.
Little Djordje liked to play Serbs and Turks, but he enjoyed most... listening epic songs about Kosovo battle and death of sultan Murat who was killed... by Milos Obilic, great hero.
Once, vicious Turk came to Djordje, little Shepard.

For some time, Djordje was outlaw with Stanoje Glavas and he killed more Turks.
Turks called him Black Djordje because of his dark ten.
In fear of Turkish revenge, he went Over Sava river to Srem, but...
His stepfather Petronije changed his mind and said that he is going to give them away to Turks if they don't come back.
It's better for me to kill him and be responsible in Gods eyes than to let Turks to kill us all.

There are words at the back.
Goat' Turkey' Pig do you know them?
I have a lot of fans in the past so I am not sure.
But look at the date!
It is the day when I was killed!
What?
That means that if we find them there might be clues?

Chan Siu Dip said 3 people murdered her and there's 3 people here!
Chan Siu Dip said

Her ghost told us!
Ghost?

Even if the detective won't help I will still help you .
Maybe the killers have already left Malaysia!
We can't find them no matter how we try!
That doesn't mean we can let the killers go!
I believe in justice!
If there is justice how come I was killed like that?

We also want to look for them!

OkOkOk
See?
Listen to the detective and don't cause any trouble!
I can't help you with anything!
Who is guy who killed himself?
His name is Yang Yau Jing, nickname is the Goat.
Goat
Goat is really dead?
I have heard that he is a gambler with a lot of debts.
In the end he hangs himself.
Hey, let me tell the truth I don't want to participate anymore.
You are giving up now?
I haven't thought that it would lead to a death I don't want to continue anymore.
Hey now that Ah Ngau quit what shall we do now?
Sorry Ah Man I think we are not going to continue too.
We are leaving.
Hey guys'
It's alright' if they don't want to help anymore I won't blame them.
Goat is dead
Ngau and the others are gone' I don't know if I am still able to help you alone
If you still want to help me can you please take me to the forest?
What?
I thought you can't leave the house?
If there's any danger...
Please help me one more time.
I think I have been here before.
What?
Try to remember if you truly have been here.
I was killed here!
Let's look around then.
I think this is the grave
What?
Try to think clearer.
So they are the people who killed you.
I should have been buried here' but where are my bones?
Someone must have dug it up before us.
Why do they do that?
They need to destroy the evidence I think the person who dug up your bones is the one who killed Goat.
Hey what happened?
Are you alright?
The sun is coming up
Are you alright?
Can you hold on?
I think I can.
It's my fault!
I shouldn't have let you leave the house.
I demanded you to take me out!
I actually need to thank you for helping me.
But we still haven't found anything useful I am already very happy that you help me all you could
Why do you say that?
You look very much like my boyfriend.
His name is Ah Cheung and he has always treated me very well.
When I was killed he cannot accept it and killed himself!
Bao Gung, why are you only eating so little?
Are you even full?
It's fate how much we can eat as long as one is happy who cares?
You don't need to save so much!
Your house has changed hands so many times and everyone in it dies a horrible death!
Everybody knows it is haunted!
What are you trying to say?
I said your house is haunted' who dares to live in there?
My house is haunted?
What then?
Right!
We are not asking you to live there!
I don't want to live there!
Let me help you find a monk to exorcise the ghost and then wait for the government to redevelop it.
You will receive millions and won't need to work again!
I have promised Sei Gor I will never sell.
I tell you' if I sell it will be torn down
How can i treat my guests then?
where can I let my friends stay then?
Bao Gung, think about it, it is very beneficial to you...
No' it is beneficial to you .
How can something be so beneficial?
You will know the truth in a few years!
Just like the old teaching
Don't be greedy!
Listen to me' Bao Gung!
Hey what are you doing?
Leave!
Get out!
I haven't played on the swing for a long time.
Ah Cheung used to let me play on the swing all the time.
You thinking of something?
No I am not.
Missing your girlfriend?
I realized that I have accused her of something she hasn't done.
When I realized my mistake it is already too late
Even though we can't be together seeing you makes me feel like I am looking at Ah Chueng again.
I hope that when you see this photo you will think like me and
What?
I hope that when you see this photo
Human and ghosts' we shouldn't mingle!

Ghost!
He is a ghost!
What?
I am not a ghost.
He said you are a ghost.
Why are you suddenly saying that I am a ghost?
Aren't you a ghost?
No he isn't.
I thought he is but he went out to the sun and it didn't affect him .
Then why do you say that you can't see his shadow in the mirror?
Now I can but just now I really can't see his shadow.
That's a painting.
Che
He is not a ghost.
If you are not a ghost then why were you chasing me?
Right!
I am not a ghost.
I was going to bring you the newspaper but hit my head I was going to bring you the newspaper but hit my head' look!
Newspaper
We are
Ghosts!
The traffic accident I saw that day it happened to you guys' you are still in a coma in a hospital.
That means that your soul have left the body' then you are ghosts!
Why have I become a ghost?
That's impossible!
That's crazy!
If I wrote it in a novel no one would believe it!
That's reality for you.
Hey!
What are you doing now?
It's time to do something!
Hey, maybe they can still be saved!
They are still in the hospital if you stop the 'Clock of life' then they will be dead for sure!
It's all your fault!
Why do you still let them walk around when their time is up?
Can you be more compassionate?
I am doing this to let her understand!
Help her then!
Why must you be so stubborn?
She is a ghost' not human.
You are being mean!
That's me if you don't like it don't talk to me!
Hey!
Wake up!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Wake up!
What now?
They seem to be dying!
Ah!
Are you alright?
Hey, be careful!
Actually you look better than alright!
Have you taken Viagra?
I don't know what happened!
I don't know suddenly I felt full of energy!
Alright!
It's great that you are feeling better.
Siu Dip and I have been to Sriracha!
That's the place where she is buried
Not only that we found out that Goat'
Turkey and Pig killed Siu Dip!
I always thought there's something strange about them !
Then why don't you say that before?
Hey!
I have an idea let's find the detective for help!
Yes great!
Let's do that now!
Hey, although you seem alright now you are actually still in a coma in a hospital!
You two are half dead how can you help?
No.
We must continue to help.
Why?
Since we are already half dead we must help her now!
A person will either go to heaven or to hell when one dies.
So?
What does that mean?
It means that we have done a lot of wrong in our life what if we are cast to hell?
That's why we need to help Siu Dip so that we can go to heaven!
Then may I ask what wrong have you done in your life?
I stole money from my mother!
I cheated in exams.
I stole my brother's underwear!
I haven't paid for my meal once.
I peek at my father having an affair with a woman.
Huh, I have touched my stepmother's ass.
I have had sex with my sister's boyfriend .
I have peeked at her sister taking a shower.
You sick bastard!
It's better than you telling me that you are a virgin!
You also told me you are a virgin!
Why talk about this now?
We are the same!
Jerk!
You are the jerk!
Everyone in your family is a jerk!
Everyone in your house is a jerk!
That's why we decide to help Siu Dip.
Alright, hallelujah and god bless you!
Don't run!
Hey, wait' what are you doing?
I think they must have something in store for us.
Wa
Ai
Wa
Wa... wa...
Hey
Hey, isn't it great?
Ha ha ha lt's really great!
Go to hell!
See how you like that!
You, you ...
Damn!
Damn' hit them!
AI ai ai
Hey!
Are you alright?
I am still alive.
I am dying!
Why do they have to hit me so hard?
We are half dead but if someone hit us again we will be totally dead!
Why suddenly beat us up?
We must be targeted by someone!
let's find the detective now!
Hey, hey!
Why stop?
What happened?
That is the detective's car he must be somewhere near!
- Right!
- Detective...
Hey, hey!
Come on come on
Aren't that the guy who beat us up?
- Right!
- That's him!
Follow him.
Thanks' Turkey Gor!
Yung Man Kin is Turkey?
He is the killer who killed me?
Your case haven't been solved but no one plans to investigate because your killer is the detective!
Yung Man Kin!
Siu Dip, calm down!
Siu Dip, are you alright?
Siu Dip, I am alright!
Hey, don't be angry
That's why the detective refuses to let us investigate!
He is Turkey!
The detective is Turkey then who is Pig?
What if we know who Pig is?
We can't prove that they are the killers.
What now then?
What?
Yung Man Kin?
Hey!
Why would Yung Man Kin call you?
Hello' yes' what?
Alright... bye.
What?
Why would Yung Man Kin call you?
Hey!
Has he discovered that we know who Turkey is?
He said he found Turkey and asked us to identity him in Sriracha.
Wait' he is Turkey why is there another Turkey?
Isn't that obvious?
He found someone to take the blame!
Then now what?
We will fail no matter what we do!
Sigh I think there is only one person who can help us now.
You are not talking about the private investigator Yip Chi Yuen are you?
That guy is so strange!
Thats what i call a master sleuth.
Yes!
He is not a master sleuth but a crazy sleuth!
Master or crazy he is our last chance, we must risk it!
Let me go too!
No!
Why not I need to catch Yung Man Kin myself!
That is why I can't let you go!
You think I will go crazy and kill him?
I can tell from your silence!
It is for your own good!
We will talk about it when we get back!
Hey, Man!
Have you called the master sleuth here?
He told us to come first, he will call us when he arrives!
Hey, why did Yung Man Kin tell us to come here?
There's not even a ghost here!
Hey!
Don't talk about ghosts you are scaring me!
Hey!
What are you doing!
Wa... wa... wa...
What are you doing!
What is this place
Wa... wa... wa...
Be calm' be calm ...
Ah!
Wa... wa... wa...
Where have you been?
I have stayed here.
You are lying!
We saw you in Sriracha!
Yes!
And we saw you killing Yung Man Kin!
He's dead?
Good!
That bastard, I wish he can die ten more times!
You are actually behind the whole thing!
You made that phone call and lured us to Sriracha!
You also used me to lure Goat and Turkey so that you can kill them' am I right?
What does it matter?
Now he is dead!
Are you happy now?
Have you killed anyone?
Tell us!
I have already told you!
He told me to stay!
How can I kill someone?
You think I will still believe you?
So you have never trusted me!
Yes
Alright, let me tell you if I could I would kill them all!
You are packing your things?
There are still lots of places to see here in Malaysia!
No thanks, there's nowhere else I want to go.
Oh' so do you distrust me or distrust Xiaodie?
Have I frightened you?
No' Bao Gung how do you know about Siu Dip?
I am the landlord' I know everything!
Let me ask you although Siu Dip is a ghost' do you think a ghost can more lovelier than a human?
I don't know!
Ask yourself!
I don't know
Actually although ghosts are scary' humans can be scarier!
Do you know why?
It is very hard to trust a human let alone a ghost!
If you want to leave I won't stop you but don't lose hope after one accident!
Don't lose trust because of 1 bad incident I tell you what is in front of you might not be real!
I tell you what is in front of you might not be real!
Why don't you trust me?
I told you I have nothing to do with him!
So you have never trusted me!
Yes!
When you see this photo you might
I start receiving awards when I was seventeen!
A foreign guy gave this to me!
Yip Chi Yuen Private Investigations
Pig!
Bao Gung!

Bei Tai ' Bei Dai ' Ah Ngau!
Hey, what?
What happened?
What?
Yip Chi Yuen is Pig!
What?
The master sleuth?
Yes' and that's not it!
I think Goat and Turkey are both killed by Pig!
What?
Then we have accused Siu Dip wrongly!
I saw him killed Bao Gung just now!
What!
Why don't you tell us sooner?
Lung Poh' what happened?
A very strong sense of killing is coming towards this place!
The sense of death is strong here!
I have heard that there is a ghost in this house who is harming people.
She has already killed two people!
Every since the owner of this house died in a horrible accident this place has became a gathering place for ghosts!
Let me cleanse this place today for the common good!
Yip Chi Yuen' what do you want?
Grand master' let me handle this let me try to reform them!
Alright!
Then I will deal with them !
You have already killed Goat and Turkey why can't you leave Siu Dip alone?
No!
Not only Siu Dip I won't let you go too!
He has a gun!
You want to escape?
Damn this monk is very powerful I am no match for him !
Lung Poh' why don't you leave with me?
If I leave and he comes out where can he find me?
Abomination!
You have hurt humans too many times!
I am not forgiving you today!
Damn you stupid monk!
You can't differentiate good ghosts from bad you are the one who is hurting everyone!
Damn you stupid monk!
I will let you know how good I am when I was young!
I will accept your challenge!
Ah damn
Ah .
Ai
Why do you have to head to certain death!
Ah ... wait!
Wait!
I am a disabled person!
I am a disabled person!
I am a mute!
I am a mute...
Yes yes we are half dead!
Yes' yes!
Hey actually this has nothing to do with us!
Haha yes
We should leave since it has nothing to do with us!
Wait what
What!
A gun!
We are all fucked!
If you haven't found me to look for the killer of Siu Dip I would never have to kill again!
Wu... wu...
30 years!
After 30 years everything should have ended!
I should have the chance to be a better person!
I have killed both Goat and Turkey!
I know that Siu Dip's ghost has come back I use this to lure them out and kill them!
Then nobody will know my secret!
That's why you all need to die!
No!
Man is in danger!
Save him!
I can hold on here!
What can you do if I leave?
Just go!
There's no where to hide!
Come out to die!
Otherwise your death will be much more painful!
Hey, I have watched the movies his gun has 1 6 bullets!
He already fired 1 4' so he only got 2 left!
So you want us to rush out out to risk his 2 bullets?
What if you counted wrong?
then we would be shot for nothing!
I am not wrong!
It's important to save him now!
Hey we are here!
Bei Tai ' Bei Dai '
Where do you think you are going?
I won't let you die so easily!
Ah
Ah Ngau ' are you alright?
Hey!
This bullet is for you!
Yip Chi Yuen!
Hey

Let's see where you can go this time!
Ya

You think I will come unprepared?
Ha
Hey

Don't promise him , Siu Dip!
Don't!
If you can let him go I will leave the world immediately and forget about everything!
Alright!
Siu Dip, Siu Dip!
Siu Dip
Siu Dip Ai!
Man' maybe we can meet again in our next life...
Siu Dip!
Why did this happen?
She finally agrees to leave the world.
Siu Dip refused to leave because she wants revenge!
Now she can give it all up because of Man do you still think she is a bad ghost?
On the other hand no matter how powerful you are you still cannot see through a human heart!
Are you afraid?
If you want to give it all up, follow me!
You are wrapped in red rope so you can never return to this world!
You two will be meeting Siu Dip soon!
Bastard
Haven't you said that you are letting us go?
You are so naive!
Hey!
I was afraid that the ghost will refuse to leave and tell everyone about what happened to her!
Now that she is gone after you are dead no one will know my secret!
That's life you have no choice!
You can't be a good person even if you wanted to!
Put down the weapon to redeem yourself!
Hey ya
Ah ... help'help!
Whatnow?
Ah .
.Yip
Chi Yuen you heartless bastard!
I will come find you even after I became a ghost!
When I killed Goat and Turkey l wrap them with red rope just like you now!
That's means you can never return to this world and find me!
Yes it's a bit hot it is going to end soon!
Hey!
Help!
Hey don't go help!
What can we do now?
Man' help me... ahhh!
Help me... helpme

He is 5 feet 1 0 inches tall' of medium build.
It is believed that he is involved lin the murder of two people in Sriracha of one Malayan Chinese and Police detective Weng Yung Man Kin .
Siu Dip has finally left the world and Ah Ngau will handle the rest of the things.
My trip has finally ended.
I have not believed Hiu Wa and Siu Dip in the end they both died for me!
And because of this I realized that for both human and ghosts trust is a very important thing!
I can finally be myself!
Mister' mister can you buy a fund-raising stamp from me?
Ah!

A vase has dropped down!
So!
Are you dead yet?
How can I die and leave you behind?

No actors appear in this film, just men, women and children who love the Seine.
Who's there, always there in the city and yet always coming and always going?
"It's a river," answers a child that unriddles riddles.
And then with sparkling eyes, he adds...
"And the river is called the Seine while the city is called Paris."
The Seine is like a person sometimes she runs and rushes past hurrying her step when evening falls.
Sometimes in spring she pulls up short and gazes at you like a mirror.
And if you cry she cries or smiles to cheer you up and always breaks into laughter when the summer sun appears.
"The Seine," says a labourer, a man of sorrows, of dreams of muscles and sweat.
"The Seine is a factory the Seine is work."
Up and downstream always the same turning handle fortunes in wine, coal and wheat which rise and fall with the river according to the tide of the market.
Fortunes in bottles and broken glass, treasure troves of rusted scrap of old bedsteads abandoned, reclaimed.
The Seine is a factory.
Even when the weather's fresh, it's always work.
The Seine, she's a song from the headsprings.
"She has the voice of youth", says a woman in love, smiling a woman in love from the Vert Galant.
A woman from the IIe des Cygnes, telling herself the same in her dreams.
"The Seine I know her as if I'd made her myself," says a tug boat pilot in a stained boiler suit streaked with oil and sun and smoke.
Risky, dangerous, tumultuous and dreamy all at once.
That's the way she is malice, caress, romance, tenderness, ...caprice, bitchiness, idleness.
If you must know, that's her real pedigree.
"The Seine is a river like any other," says a disenchanted voice of a correct and blase man one of the first passengers of the latest sterilized tourist boats.
A river with bridges, docks and quays a river with eddies from sewers and sometimes a drowned man, if it is not a dead dog.
With anglers who never catch a thing.
A river like any other, and I'll be the first to lament her.
And the Seine hears laughter and slips away like a cat.
A river like any other any other any other.
A waterway like any other waterway.
Water from glaciers and torrents and underground lakes and melted snow and vanished clouds.
A river like the Durance or the Guadalquivir or the Amazon or Moselle, the Rhine, the Thames or the Nile.
A river like the River Love like the River Love, sings the broadening Seine and at night the Milky Way accompanies its tender golden murmur and also the railway with its usual muffled din.
"A river like the River Love...
"Do you hear the beauty, the cooing?" says a lord of the barges, a summer visitor on the Rapee quay.
The River Love you speak as if I'm indifferent.
It isn't a river, the Seine it's love in person.
It's my river.
My little daybreak, my little trip round the world my life's holidays.
The Louvre, Tuileries, Eiffel and Pointue Towers and Notre Dame, Obelisk, Gare de Lyon, Austerlitz they are my chateaux of the Loire.
The Seine, it's my Riviera and me, I'm its true tourist and when it runs cold and naked, howling complaints against strangers you have to be short on memory to call it distress, misery or despair but fairy tales and nightmares should not be confused.
And then when below the Pont Neuf the dying day's wind blows out my candle when I withdraw from the business of life when I'm finally at ease in the grand palace of those at rest at Bagneux at Pere Lachaise, I shall smile and say to myself:
There once was the Seine once there once was love there once was misfortune and another time forgetfulness.
There once was the Seine and once there was life.
The End
Subtitles:
Verbatim Yucatan, 23.976 fps.
For every action...
There is an equal, and opposite, reaction.
North Pole
EL MONSTRUO ALADO
Radar, designed to defend us against attack.
Radar stations on Mountain tops...
In deserts, deep in untracked forests.
In a thousand, secret and isolated places.
Over both oceans there are radar equipped picket planes.
In both oceans, manmade radar islands to guard our flanks.
There are the inshore pickets, and several hundred miles beyond them are the off shore pickets.
Another radar fence stretches across the long unfortified border between the United States and Canada.
A pine tree radar fence.
And beyond that...
Still another network of electronic eyes.
The Mid Canada Radar Fence.
Even farther north, in the very shadow of the North pole this fence... the Distant Early Warning System known as the DEW line.
Ready to transmit the first warning signal of a sneak attack across the polar region.
To build the DEW line an armada of ships was assembled in the largest, and most secretly planned operation since the Normandy Invasion.
Grinding through treacherous polar ice fields in a desperate gamble against time and weather
To land a mountain of supplies, machines, tractors, and men upon the ice.
First things first, level landing strips for heavy cargo planes,
then shelters for the men, for the planes, and for operations.
... and while some hands are busying laying long pipelines to transport fuel, others build tanks to store it.
The work continues, day and night, around the clock, 7 days a week.
At long last, the ships are gone, the summer is gone, but the job is finished.
Red Eagle One, centennial of the Arctic, nerve center of the DEW line, is operational.
Colonel Parkman arriving, dispatch jeep.
Colonel Parkman?
Glad to have you with us.
Across the roof of the continent still farther north, an outpost of the DEW line.
Hey Mike, Hey Mike, get a look at this.
I don't see anything.
Hey wait a minute...
Listen!
It's almost on top of us!
This is Kane, picket 7327 calling Red Eagle One come in Red Eagle One.
This is Kane, picket 7327 calling Red Eagle One...
Come in Red Eagle One.
Hello 7327 this is Red Eagle One, I read you, over.
Put the old man on the horn would you Pete?
... right, roger.
I've got Lieutenant Kane Sir.
Colonel Parkman, Walter?
What's up!
We're over Weather 4 sir,
The building has been damaged.
Looks like the roof's caved in.
If there's anyone inside they could be hurt, or worse.
I tried to contact them, but there was no answer, over.
We'll get right on it!
Over and out.
When did Weather 4 report in last?
At uh, zero eight hundred, sir, right on the button.
See if you can contact them again.
alright.
Red Eagle One calling Weather 4, Red Eagle One calling Weather 4, come in Weather 4.
No answer, sir.
Keep trying.
Red Eagle One calling Weather 4, Red Eagle One calling Weather 4, come in Weather 4.
Operations, Colonel Parkman here, get my plane ready... (Red Eagle One Calling Weather 4...) ... oh and uh, alert Lt. Pizar.
Red Eagle One calling Weather 4, Red Eagle One calling Weather 4, come in Weather 4.
Two men don't just vanish!
These did.
I don't get it.
Everything was under control when they checked in at zero eight hundred.
Nothing unusual has been reported since then.
No storms...
It wasn't a gale that wrecked this shack.
The sides are caved out as though something crashed into the roof.
Well, if it was a plane that hit it...
Maybe, there's a very ordinary explanation for what happened.
Maybe the men are on the way back to base right now.
On foot?
They would leave footprints in the snow.
Do you see any?
Take a look here!
What do you got?
I don't know!
A plane?
No plane never made that short a run.
A helicopter?
No, a helicopter couldn't make a burrow like this.
If there is an ordinary explanation of what happened, then...
I wouldn't take any bets.
So, the only recent contact you had with the weather shack was when the helicopter dropped supplies there five days ago?
Yes sir.
You checked Weather 1?
Yes sir.
Weather 4 made contact with them at zero eight one three.
Everything was Jake!
I'm picking up something Colonel, but it doesn't make sense.
I never saw a blip like that before.
It's there, then it's gone!
Hey, there it is again.
What do you make of it.
I'm not taking any chances.
Sound the red alert!
Vector 360 climb to Angels 3, bogey 90 miles.
Red leader to Control.
Nothing here.
Give us a new Vector.
Bogey has disappeared, Return to home plate.
Jerry!
Sugar Fly to Red Eagle One...
Come in Red Eagle One.
Sugar Fly to Red Eagle One.
Come in Red Eagle One.
Hello Sugar Fly, this is Red Eagle One, go ahead.
Red Eagle One, we're over the wreckage of the C47.
They found it Colonel!
Get his position.
Yes sir.
Alert Lieutenant Pizar.
Yes sir.
Colonel!
Looks just like the weather shack.
Yeah.
Where are they?
Where are the bodies?
Easy.
Look out!
What in the world is...
What is it?
I don't know.
Looks like it had been broken off of something.
That point's as sharp as a needle.
I give up.
You got me.
Well where do we go from here?
We'll have to let CONAD worry about that.
This is CONAD.
The Continental Air Defense Command, at Colorado Springs.
The focal point of the super sonic shield that guards the North American Continent.
A shield that could mean the difference between life and death for millions of Americans.
These are Hot phones!
Using them it takes only 15 seconds, to talk to Alaska, 10 seconds to alert Newfoundland,
5 seconds to contact you!
3 seconds to reach the Pentagon Command Post.
General Ford Speaking...
Yes.
I see.
Good, I'll take a plane right out.
The Arctic command has delivered the package.
Good afternoon gentlemen.
I'm General Ford.
Oh No, no, Please, sit down.
Gentlemen...
I realize that the Air Force hasn't given you much time in which to make your tests..
... and a definitive job may have been out of the question in the short time you've had, but the Department of Defense hopes that during these two days of concentrated efforts, you've come to some conclusion about this.
Professor Gunther I believe you are in charge.
All of us are agreed to accept one thing this appendage comes from some living creature.
... but as to what creature, it was once a part of, we we are completely in the dark.
Our mathamist, Dr. Arnold Burton, has been unable to identify this object.
Professor Harvy Pierce is certain from his exploration that the "hook", cannot belong to the neurological system.
Well you seem to know more about what it isn't than what it is.
That is correct, sir.
Gentlemen let's be logical.
Now you tell me that this, "hook" comes from something that's alive.
alright.
But it wasn't a part of the cargo and it wasn't in the plane when it took off, so it must have come aboard, after the crash.
Right?
That sounds logical...
Now what was it that came aboard?
It shouldn't be so difficult.
You know the animal life of the Arctic.
We have asked ourselves that, General.
You're not suggesting that it comes from some creature at present, unknown?
It's a possibility we suggest you investigate, sir.
How?
We recommend that you ask Dr. Nedrick Jackson of the museum of Natural History here in Washington, to look into this.
He's their chief Paleontologist and the countries leading authority on the Ali gasi and Carnivori
You've lost me professor.
He deals with life of past geological periods... as shown by the fossil remains of, plants and animals.
He has been able to re-construct prehistoric creatures with, no more to start with then a hand full of bones.
"Departamento de Paleontologia" Dr. Jackson.
Curator.
Hi Marge.
Hi.
What have you got there?
A kid in my junior science group made it.
Even added an extra vertebrae as though it doesn't have enough already.
Here, want to count them?
Listen, if I'm ever to get next months issue of the magazine out we better start working.
I've got a feature.
Life parades through the ages.
Showing the progression of prehistoric creatures from the jelly fish, to the dinosaur, to primitive man.
Sounds alright.
... and I'm going to include the pictures we took on your last field trip.
That's even better.
Oh, excuse me.
Jackson talking.
The Pentagon?
Sure I'll wait.
What do you know maybe they want to call me back in the service.
This is Dr. Jackson.
General Ford?
Yes.
Yes.
I see General.
Of course sir I'll be right over.
Everything alright?
... course.
It isn't every day the Pentagon calls you.
You're very nosy.
Okay be mysterious.
Well if I tell you, you'll keep it a secret?
Hope to die!
They found an old bone up at the North Pole.
The Pentagon wants to know, to whom it belongs.
It doesn't look like bone.
More like gristle or cartilage.
A structure as large as this would have to serve a very specialized purpose in order to be cartelized.
Have you any idea what it comes from?
No, not the faintest.
If it were bone we could start from that.
What it does tell me however, is that it can't be from an animal.
Because every known species of animal has a bony skeleton.
As a matter of fact the reptile structure is bony and gentlemen, even birds have bony skeletons.
Looks like we're getting nowhere fast.
On the contrary we're making considerable progress.
At least we know what it can't be, which is bound to lead us to what it is.
Well then is there anything that doesn't have a bony skeleton?
Lots of things: worms, snails, insects, shell fish.
Some invertebrates where there skeletons on the outside, well it an outer shell called an exoskeleton which is hard and rigid enough to protect the internal organs.
Insects have thin flexible places within their heads and bodies which allows them freedom of movement.
Then they have folds where the muscles are attached.
It's a possibility.
An Insect?
That's where the process of elimination seems to lead us.
Of course if it is an insect it certainly doesn't tell us what kind it is.
Well find that out partly from what we know, but mostly from what deduce.
Doc you're beginning to sound like Sherlock Holmes.
Sort of.
Professor Gunther, the fluid from the end of the hook...
You had it analyzed?
Well we, did what we could in the time we had.
Of course you didn't know exactly what you were looking for.
Precisely.
Well I'm not too much of an entomologist, but I do seem to remember...
With very few exceptions the blood of insects contains no red corpuscles.
Now that we suspect this hook may have come from an insect...
Would you test the fluid for me and let me know what you get?
Be glad to.
Thanks.
Well General, that's about it.
Professor Gunther will make his test and...
We'll see what we can dream up.
Do you think we'll get somewhere?
We'll do our best.
"POLAR TRAGEDY REVEALED" "Air Force Discloses Mystery Accident and Disappearance
So that's what they wanted to see you about.
Don't you play games with me Ned Jackson.
I'm sorry.
There's an old saying that you can't keep anything from the press and even if I'm only running a museum mag, ... I haven't lost my nose for news.
That is what it's about.
Maybe...
I know it is!
Maybe not!
Well it's a plain at the nose on your face!
Look.
The Pentagon has never consulted you before.
The papers say they have a mystery on their hands.
One and one still make two, so it follows that they must need information in your field.
Oh Ned, give me a break.
You don't know what it would mean if I could run a story about something that took place in this century!
Well I...
They didn't say it was restricted.
You see?
alright it's, it's like the paper says.
There have been crashes and disappearances.
But the real story is, what they found at the last crash.
It's, well it's about 5 feet long.
It's modeled green in color.
Probably broken off the body some place.
What are you talking about.
It's part of something alive.
Something that must incredibly, unbelievably huge.
I think it's from an insect.
An Insect?
Here.
Doesn't look very fearsome reduced in size like that does it?
No, no it doesn't.
It looks like the spur on the leg of a grasshopper or a cricket.
Grasshoppers and crickets aren't meat eaters and at least 5 men have disappeared.
If that is part of an insect...
It's from the biggest creature that ever lived.
Are you sure you are feeling alright?
there were long skid marks in the snow as... as though the thing flew in for a landing.
Jackson talking.
Oh hello Professor Gunther.
You have.
I see sir, thank you.
Well they just finished the blood tests.
There were no red corpuscles.
It's from an Insect.
... and the ant inside this amber is at least 90 million years old.
Now we've been able to learn from pieces of amber like this...
That certain ancient insect forms have continued without variation until today.
That others have changed to meet changing conditions and certain species have vanished completely.
I just can't believe that an insect as large as you suggest ever existed.
Look behind you on the wall professor.
That prehistoric dragonfly measures 2 feet from wing tip to wing tip.
... and like the modern dragonfly, it too was a flesh eater.
alright, it's big, but it's only 2 feet.
Is that the best you can do?
I never suggested I was looking for a dragonfly.
So what are you looking for?
To be honest with you I'm, not exactly sure.
You're a pathologist Professor Gunther.
The field of pathology is limited.
But the paleontologist field is narrow to what we understand.
On the contrary we stretch our understanding to, try and take in the universe.
alright, suppose, just for the sake of argument that we admit such an insect once existed.
How could it be alive today?
Exactly!
Even the recently discovered prehistoric Siberian mammals were dead.
The natives ate the flesh, used the skin for clothing, made tools from the ivory tusks.
But the mammoths were dead.
Are you sure they were dead?
Why?
Everyone knows they were.
Everyone says they were.
Suppose the Siberians hadn't been in such a hurry to slice them up for steaks.
Suppose they were still alive when found in the ice.
Does your learned young friend always go on like this?
alright professor,
You know as well as I do that if a living organism is frozen quickly enough it's theoretically possible to stop the living protoplasm from changing their geometrical pattern.
Which always happens when death occurs.
Theoretically yes.
Is it unreasonable then to ask yourself...
Whether the mammoths might have remained alive all those years, ... and it was the Siberians who killed them before they had a chance to thaw out and breathe again!
You... you believe this?
Well I don't disbelieve it!
And I'll go along with it until someone comes up with a better theory.
Look, five men have vanished.
To die is one thing.
To disappear without a trace suggests... complete destruction!
A flesh eating creature!
But there are scores of insects that live on other insects.
Where do you start?
By thinking of the hook as though it were infinitely smaller.
As though it were part of an insect no larger than those we know today.
Like oh, the grasshopper, the beetle, or the cricket, then ask yourself...
What flesh eating insect of normal size, has such a hook?
Ned, you're making a lot of assumptions.
Every paleontologist does.
Look, you start with a jaw bone, a couple of teeth, you figure whether they come from a flesh or a grass eater and you go from there!
A normal insect, that is a flesh eater.
I've narrowed the field to one!
The diet consist mostly of small insects such as leafhoppers, grasshoppers, caterpillars and others.
A substantial part of the diet may also include small frogs and lizards.
The female is larger than the male and invariably destroys her mate when he's fulfilled his function in life.
Now the hook they found on the plane may very well be a spur from one of its forelegs.
If this is it, as large as a monstrous creature we looking for I doubt whether anything that ever lived could be as deadly.
It's strong beyond anything it's size suggests.
It walks, leaps, and flies.
It's appetite is insatiable.
You mean, this cute little bug?
Yeah, that cute little bug.
In all the kingdom of the living there is no more deadly or voracious creature.
... than the Preying Mantis.
GREENLAND ESKIMOS TERRORIZED
Anything new on the disaster, General?
Nothing else gentlemen.
Hey, uh, you're Dr. Jackson of the Museum of Natural History, aren't you?
That's right.
Well what have you been called in for?
Dr. Jackson is an old friend of mine.
That's not answering his question, General.
You're a Paleontologist isn't this out of your line?
Have you any theories Dr. Jackson?
Gentlemen, if you were in my position and what you had was a theory, not facts, just a theory,
I'm sure you'd withhold it to avoid any speculation that might prove disastrous.
I'm sure you realize this and that you'll co-operate with us to avoid panic, or hysteria.
I know I can count on all of you.
Well, Good luck to you Ned.
Thanks, I'll do my best.
Hi!
Almost ready?
If can close this.
I'm told the Air Force doesn't like to be kept waiting.
Oh I'm coming.
Here, make yourself useful.
Nice of you to see me off.
I think so.
You know, the Arctic is about the only place where I haven't worked in.
Are those mine too?
No Doctor, they're mine.
Oh...
Yours?
Well you couldn't go alone without your photographer, could you?
My what?
Well I phoned General Ford's office and requested permission for you to take your photographer along.
I guess he forgot to tell you.
Boy this is really going to be a story.
You'll do almost anything for a story wouldn't you?
Almost.
Well come on!
Colonel.
Colonel, sir.
Uh, Dr. Jackson is here from ah, Washington.
He's got a...
I mean there's a, there's a...
We...
Well speak up!
He's with a woman.
A female woman.
I thought they'd stopped making them.
Then show them in.
Yes sir.
I'm Ned Jackson Colonel, I'm sure that Washington...
Excuse me, this is Miss Marjorie Blain;
Colonel Joe Parkman.
El General Ford sent me up.
I'm magazine editor for the Museum of Natural History.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Uh, that will be all men.
It looks like you don't have too many women up here Colonel.
Ah we have a little joke up here...
The boys say there's a girl behind every tree.
Only try and find a tree.
Well when do we see what we came for.
I'll have a plane any time you're ready.
I'm ready.
Fine.
These are the skid marks.
At least what's left of them.
We found the same marks at the weather shack, and the Eskimo village.
Here Colonel.
Got it?
Eight and a half feet.
Let's get back to the plane.
At ease.
Gentlemen, this is Marjorie Blaine.
I thought you wouldn't mind too much if she had a look around your recreation room.
Aw she's like a butterfly.
Light and crosses absolutely boss.
Yes Corporal?
Well, ah, with your permission sir...
Would it be alright if...
would it be alright if I asked Miss Blaine to dance, sir?
Corporal that decision is entirely up to Miss Blaine.
Yes sir.
Miss Blaine would you care to...
Well, what I mean is... while I'm not yes Corporal I'd love to.
Oh hi.
Hi.
Hi Ned.
Thought you were going to join us.
Ah I've been busy.
You two run along, have fun.
What are you up to?
I'm trying to find out how big this thing is.
You know, people used to think that carnivorous plants were the funk.
Actually there are about 450 species of them.
Some are almost 6 feet tall.
I'm convinced that we're dealing with a Mantis and whose geological world the smallest insects were as large as man.
And, the failing to find those insects for its food, it's...
Well it's, doing the best it can.
If there is such a thing why hasn't anybody seen it?
Well those who have are dead!
Ah, who can be sure?
It may have been locked in a prison of ice millions of years ago.
Well what could have released it after all that time?
Oh, any sort of unusual vibration,
You know how, mountain climbers are afraid of thunder?
Well, it's because the sound of the vibration may start an avalanche.
Hit the alert button!
Yes sir!
Operations!
Colonel Parkman speaking...
Condition Red!
Scramble all aircraft immediately!
Condition Red!
Coffee Colonel?
Nine hours and not a whisper.
Which is alright with me.
Red Eagle One, this is Otter 4
Hello Otter 4, this is Red Eagle One, go ahead.
We have nothing here.
Request permission to return to base.
Over.
Request denied, continue search procedure.
Over and out.
The only thing to do is to keep the patrols out straight around the clock until we're sure.
And remember I want a report on anything from Mid Canada, or Pine tree.
Anything.
You understand?
Yes sir.
Got the Mid Canada Radar Fence on the line sir.
This is Colonel Parkman.
Oh Colonel, Blue Captain Hawkins, here.
This is just a stab in the dark but you chaps asked us to report anything unusual and... yes...
As I said, it may not mean a thing, but we caught an unidentified object in our scope.
Could have been a storm or a weather balloon.
It was a faint signal that came a West.
But it might be that oversized bug of yours?
What time was it?
Early.
Zero four hundred I suspect.
Thanks Hawkins.
Thanks very much.
Zero four hundred, that's almost six hours after he left here.
Now it's 1500 miles to the Mid Canada line.
Oh that's no good he'd have to be doing better than 200 miles an hour.
Why not Joe?
We're dealing with an insect.
The deer fly does 600 an hour!
Well that's almost as fast as a jet!
The Mid Canada line is 1500 miles South of here, right?
Right.
And, where was that Weather shack 4?
Right there, straight on the eightieth meridian.
And the, and the C47 crash was here.
That's right, due South of the Weather shack.
What are you getting at Ned?
And the Eskimo village?
Right there, between us and the C47.
Hey wait a minute.
He's been going straight South!
And he'll keep going South till he reaches the tropics where he'll find the same kind of climate and jungle vegetation from which he came originally.
Now let's see he'll probably pass over Labrador, Nova Scotia, then he'll hit the Gulf Stream.
And I'm sure the warm air above the Gulf Stream will attract him and he'll follow it all the way down to South America.
I've got CONAD on the hot line Colonel.
They say it's important.
Thanks.
This is Colonel Parkman.
Are you sure?
Thanks.
Pine Tree got it too.
It went through Newfoundland.
Well it looks like we're on our way to Washington.
Come on Marge.
Grab your toothbrush.
"MANTIS REPORTED AT BANGOR" "AIR FORCE ALERTED!"
"CURFEW ORDERED IN NEW ORLEANS!" "Fear of Mantis Mounting"
"CONGRESSMAN CALLS MANTIS HOAX" "DEMANDS INVESTIGATION"
All over the United States this morning...
Some 400,000 members, of the civilian ground observer corp are gathered to learn more about this fantastic creature.
This program is being presented by the Continental Air Defense Command.
Our first speaker is Major General Mark Ford.
- General Ford.
Thank you.
I want to say at the outset...
That contrary to rumor, and certain newspaper headlines, the so called deadly Mantis is no imaginary scare.
It's a very real and, present danger.
With me this morning is Colonel Parkman.
Commanding officer of an advanced radar interceptor base deep in the Arctic Circle.
Colonel Parkman.
Thank you sir.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
I saw this creature attack our base.
I visited the weather shack, and I also inspected the wreckage of the aircraft that this thing destroyed.
Now we have every reason to believe that the Mantis is flying South...
Along the Gulf Stream.
And we believe that it will be one you devoted men and women of the Civilian Ground Observer Corp who will spot it next time it appears.
I have with me today Dr. Nedrick Jackson...
Curator of the department of Paleontology at the Museum of Natural History.
Dr. Jackson has something important to show you.
Doctor.
Gentlemen.
Thank you.
This object, is a spur broken off the fore leg of the Mantis when it destroyed the C47.
Now the spur of a normal size Mantis is so small it's difficult to measure.
This spur, as you can see, is nearly 5 feet long which will give you some idea as to the creature's size.
Thank you, doctor.
Now you ground observers are well trained in the identification of aircraft.
Here, to scale, is the deadly Mantis, and here, is the C47, which it destroyed.
One other thing.
You spotters should listen for a loud droning sound, much like that of a squadron of heavy bombers flying in formation.
Now the Coast Guard and the Navy have been alerted and are standing by...
On the Eastern seaboard.
If the Mantis is sited the procedure will be the same as though an enemy aircraft had been spotted.
Take no chances.
Report any unusual flying objects.
Thank you.
Target is down!
Target is down!
Cannot confirm kill, due to low overcast.
Returning to Carrier.
Out.
Well, here comes another one.
Granary fire in Minneapolis.
Minneapolis not a stir.
There's some power lines down near Richmond.
Richmond Virginia?
Yeah.
There's some birds flying in Fresno.
Fresno, Fresno...
Oh, I'm so tired.
Where is Fresno?
California?
Fresno, California.
Hi.
Hi Marge.
Hello.
Ned.
Hey, what are you up to?
Well, it's kind of a private deal.
We call it operation Marge because she dreamed it up.
Oh?
We're charting every unusual occurrence in the country.
Some may have been caused by the Mantis.
This might give us a clue.
Any luck?
Well they're too scattered to mean anything yet.
You kids know what time it is.
It's after midnight.
Now you're dismissed, both of you....
But General I have the...
No "buts" about it.
You heard what the General said.
Your going straight home young lady.
And I'm the guy whose taking you.
Night Ned.
Goodnight Marge.
Weinterruptthisprogram to bring you a news flash
Atrainwreckhas beenreportednorth of Laurel, Maryland, on U.S. highway one.
TheEngineand5cars were overturned in what appears to have been a freak accident.
Wewillbringyou furtherdetails as they come in.
It's only a few miles from here.
We'll have a look.
Sorry Colonel, been a train wreck.
You'll have to back to Warrington road.
Take the detour to your left, to Laurel.
Pretty bad?
Could have been a lot worse.
How'd it happen?
Probably couldn't see the warning in the fog.
Can't tell for sure.
The Engineer is still unconscious.
Joe do you think it might...
No.
It's just an accident.
Come on.
Let's go.
Gracias.
The light just turned green.
It's too dangerous to drive in fog like this.
Remember what happened to that train back there.
M-m-m, this is more dangerous.
We better get going.
Oh, you forgot your package lady!
thank you driver.
You know, it's good to get home safely with all these strange things going on around here.
Oh there's nothing to worry about 'mam.
You just be careful out in that fog.
thank you.
It'stheverylatestreport!

Take it easy!
How about a couple of blankets up here.
What happened?
Haven't got any idea Colonel.
Something must have lifted the bus and smashed it.
The front end's okay so we know it didn't run into anything.
You boys might just as well go back.
There aren't any bodies!
Oh say, take care of this lady for me, will you please.
Attention, all military and civil defense personnel.
Attention, all police and fire department personnel.

Give me pigeons to home plate.
Hey Clark!
They said on television that the flyer who shot him down is going in the tunnel after him.
Did you see it crawl into the tunnel?
Hey bud!
Hey, hey bud!
Bud!
Hey!
Hey bud, is it still in the tunnel?
It ain't out here Mac!
Anybody killed?
I only know what I read in the papers!
Hey smart guy, I thought I told you to stay out of that road, now come on get back there!
" I'm going home and watch it on TV." Why go ahead home and watch it on TV.
Alright, don't push!
" I'll push..." I see anything anyway
Yeah, tell it to your neighbor will ya!
That's all the smoke we need.
Shut it off!
How much longer do you think it'll take?
Well we got about a 90 percent saturation of smoke in the tunnel now!
I don't think we can do any better, General.
We'll be lucky if we can hold what we've got.
Those wet tarpaulins will hold the smoke alright.
Just keep pumping!
Everything's under control on the Jersey side sir.
what about the smoke?
It's packed in solid the tarp's holding it fine.
Did you go inside?
Yes sir, but we didn't get too close.
How far in do you estimate it to be?
Oh I'd ah, I'd say, about a quarter of a mile from this end.
That puts the Mantis below the water line.
I don't think we ought to wait much longer, sir.
What do you think Ned?
It's no question in my mind that he's mortally wounded.
If we can keep him in that tunnel he'll die!
Is there anything between us and the Mantis on this end?
17 cars, according to the automatic counter.
If he breaks through those tunnel walls we'll have a flood on our hands.
What do you say, General?
Go ahead, Joe.
Good luck Joe.
Alright men.
You've all been told what to do.
Now the purpose of that smoke in there is to give us cover.
Use it!
Now which of you men is carrying the chemical mines?
Stay up front with me!
And remember, those 3-R-G mines are effective only in a limited area.
So watch for my signal before you throw them.
Alright men, Take Masks!
Let's go!
There's your cover for next months magazine, Marge.
Well go on, take your picture.
Would you mind telling me what's so funny Colonel?
Who me?
Well nothing at all.
Can I help you with the Camera?
No thanks.
Exactly where did you crash into him, Joe?
Well, just about center of the right hand side.
If you follow me, I'll show you.
There.
I think you can see right there, sir.
It's at the uh, base of the neck.
Ned what do you call...
Look out Marge!
I thought you said you killed him?
Don't blame Joe, that was an auto-reflex mechanism, it's dead alright.
Here, put me down.
I said, put me down!
What's the matter?
Don't you like it up here?
I've got pictures to take!
Well, that can wait.
This is no place for romance Joe Parkman.
What about my pictures?
Let Ned do it.
ha, ha, ha, ha....

Welcome home, man.
Come sit down and give us a tune.
- We'll pay you with promises.
- A man can't eat promises.
He can't lose them at cards either.
McLaine!
- No, indeed he can't.

They were laying track in Wyoming.
Needed a troubleshooter.

You can pick up a few nickels and dimes playing your accordion.
That's right, Tim.
What's this?
Playing cards with matches?
When's payday?
Tomorrow, if they get the money past Whitey Harbin.
Which they won't.
He's tapped that pay train three times up.
They'll get it past him or get no more steel before snow.

Day shift and night shift, night shift and day shift.
No money in a month.
My patience is ended.
So is their railroad.
Am I right?
- You are right!
- McLaine.
Please play me a peaceful tune or I'll have a revolution on my hands.
I see what you mean.
Are they giving you trouble?
Lucky you're not with the railroad.

Big Ed, are you through to Junction City?
This is for Kimball.
As per your instructions, this is to advise you that Grant McLaine is here at end of track.
You don't need that last.
Just say he's here.
Get away from him!
Get away from him!
Dancing, is it?
Let me...
Get back into your tent where you belong, you painted women.
You and your railroad.
Bringing the likes of this among decent folk.
For two cents I'd take me old man back to Junction City and be through with you.
If you had two cents!
They're at it again.
You can't mix wives and women, even to build a railroad.
Stop this shilly-shally music and give me a jig I can dance to.
Give us a jig, I said.
You watch your feet.
They're heavy.
And so is my fist.
Do I get a jig or do you lose your teeth?
Not now, Mac, not now.
He's not bad.
He's just a fool.
Consider yourself lucky.
Five years ago you'd have got a bullet between the eyes.
I've seen him kill men that could eat you without salt.
Play what you please.
(?
Lively jig)
- You asked for a jig, now dance to it!
- Here I go, Feeney!
Hee-hee!
Up Garryowen!
?
I was farming in Missouri I was getting tired of that
?
So I bought myself a satchel and a stovepipe hat
?
And I headed for the station gonna travel all about
?
But there wasn't any station and I soon found out
?
That you can't get far without a railroad
?
You can't get far without a railroad
?
Something's gotta take you there and gotta bring you back
?
Oh, you can't go any distance in a buggy or a hack
?
You can't get far without a railroad
?
You can't get far without a railroad
?
You gotta have an engine and you gotta have a track
?
Oh, you can't get far without a railroad?
I haven't heard that one.
Where does it come from?
Dad used to play it when it got too rough around the house.
Pretty soon us kids would stop fighting and start dancing.
The man makes fine music.
Are we gonna let them use it all up?
Go on with you!
Clarence Feeney, stop looking at them painted hussies and give your wife a dance.
- Go away, woman, I'm tired.
- Tired, is it?
This is my day for dancing or fighting.
Which will you have?
Darling.
Nice work.
I'll give you five dollars tomorrow.
If Whitey lets the pay train through.
Three times is enough.
He won't hit it again.
Oh, don't bet on it.
He's a strange man, this Whitey Harbin.
He's got the big boss plenty worried.
Speaking of Kimball, he wants to see you.
- How would he know where I am?
- I told him.
Here.
You read it.
I'm afraid if I stop the music, Mrs Feeney'll hit me with something.
"Report to me at once in Junction City.
Urgent.
Ben Kimball."
- Maybe he'll give you...
- Another chance?
No.
That's not his way.
- But you will see him?
- Not till they've finished their dance.
- You old hag, I'll...
- Painted hussy!
(Groaning)
Let go of me!
Let go!
Let her go, I said!
(Woman screams)
(Groaning)
(Stops playing)
(Shouting)
(Screaming)
- Hold this.
- Right.
And this is the tune your father used to play to keep peace in the house?
I must have squeezed out a few wrong notes.
Yeah.
- Thanks, Tim.
- Goodbye, Mac.
(Woman screeches)
- Too late for coffee, mister?
- (Woman) Howdy.
I think there's a few warm dregs left.
- Oh.
Howdy, ma'am.
- Step down.
Much obliged.
- They keeping you busy?
- Yep.
Packing out the ore and packing in the vittles.
Them miners can eat more beans than they raise in all of Boston.
- Now they want me to bring in a mill.
- All at once?
No, just a few pieces at a time.
They got tired of waiting for the railroad to reach them.
Between you and me, I don't think it will before snow.
You're hoping it won't?
- First I was.
- Uh-huh.
Figured it'd put me out of business.
It won't.
- It won't?
- No.
It's a funny thing about gold.
There's always some jackass will find it where the railroad ain't.
Then he'll send for me and a few more jackasses to bring in his grub and pack out his ore!
Them crazy miners!
Look at the waste of that good machinery.
Two miles of cable and buckets to go with it.
Last week they up and left the whole thing!
Did the vein pinch out or did they hit low grade?
They didn't hit nothing but blue sky.
Uh-huh.
- This was mighty fine coffee, Mrs...
- Miss Vittles.
Miss Vittles.
I sure appreciate it.
- I got a long ride ahead of me.
- You heading for Junction City too?
Yes, ma'am.
But I'm kind of in a hurry.
I ain't looking for company.
Ten jackasses in a bunch is enough.
- I can save you a trip round the mountain.
- How's that?
Like I told you, the boys hit a good vein, followed it through the mountain.
Last week they busted out on the far side and there wasn't nothing there but blue sky.
Makes a mighty fine short cut into town.
- It sure does.
- Still think I'm crazy?
- I think you're real pretty.
- Ah!
- You going to spend time in these hills?
- Yes, ma'am.
When snow comes you're gonna need a woman.
Or a warm coat, else you'll freeze your knees.
Well, I can't rightly afford a warm coat.
So long, Miss Vittles.
People wonder what a calf feels when he gets roped.
Now you can tell 'em.
What for are you mixing in?
Maybe I don't like to see kids get hurt.
Break any bones, son?
He's got a knife behind his collar!
- There's a stirrup.
You want a lift?
- No.
- Why not?
- I'm beholden to you, mister.
Couldn't we just leave it that way?
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Put him up?
- For how long?
- I wouldn't know.
- It'll be two bits for oats.
- Ain't I seen you before?
- Depends on where you've been.
- I follow the railroad, mostly.
- Could be you've seen me.
- It'll be four bits if he stays the night.
- Fair enough.
Morning.
Did a man ride in today - tall, sort of heavyset?
- You mean him, Mr Renner?
- Not him.
This one had a scar.
Along his cheek?
No, sir.
I don't see no man with a scar.
I guess maybe I can have some apple pie and coffee.
I guess you could have eggs with bacon if you wanted eggs with bacon.
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Grant.
It's good to see you, Charlie.
It's awful good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
- I'll get the eggs.
- No, get the pie.
I can pay for the pie.
You're a very stubborn man.
Apple pie is not for breakfast.
It is if you like apple pie.
Now I need a fork.
- Working here long?
- About three weeks.
How's the Utica Kid?
He was well... when I saw him last.
When was that?
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Well, business is early and Pete is late.
The lunches.
Are they fixed?
Why do I ask?
The lunches are always fixed.
Why?
Because you fix them.
Charlie, I'll make you an omelette like only Pete can make an omelette.
Very bad.
Come on around, sit down, have a cup of coffee.
Pete had that place in Santa Fe, remember?
Are you running a shoe store on the side?
Those are box lunches for the work train.
Money, money, money.
Pete knows how to make it.
He follows the railroad.
I guess a lot of people follow the railroad.
You and Pete.
The Utica Kid.
I asked when you saw him last.
They've lost three payrolls.
Now when did you see him last?
- Charlie, where did I put my apron?
- It's under here.
You must be nice fella.
If Charlie sits with you, you must be nice fella.
I make omelette for you too.
We were talking about the Utica Kid.
He can wait.
Ben Kimball's in town.
They put his car on the siding yesterday.
- I know.
- His wife is with him.
Is she?
I often wondered what Verna was like.
I saw her last night.
All fine silk and feathers.
She's soft and beautiful.
And I can understand now.
Can you?
How long are you gonna be in town?
- That depends on Ben Kimball.
- You working for the railroad again?
- If I am?
- That would be good.
Playing the accordion's not for you, not for a living.
You belong to the railroad and it belongs to you.
There were a lot of things that used to belong to me and somehow I lost them.
(Pete) Two omelettes a-comin' up.
- Do you like eggs?
- No.
That's too bad.
You got an omelette coming up.
Well, somebody's gotta eat them.
Come on.
That means you.
- Could you put it in a box?
- An omelette?
I'll be hungrier when I get to end of track.
Maybe it will go down easy.
Easy or not, it goes down right now.
I can't pay for it.
Then you can help me sell lunches at the station.
Any more arguments?
(Train rattling)
(Train whistle)
(Knocking)
Come in.
- You want to see me, Ben?
- I certainly do.
Hello, Grant.
Sit down.
All right, Jeff.
Renner, go to Pete's and get one breakfast and a jug of coffee.
- You haven't eaten yet?
- I've eaten.
Just get coffee.
Hot.
- How's everything been going?
- I make a living.
- Playing an accordion?
- That's right.
Want me to play a tune for you?
There's other jobs besides railroading.
Well, Colorado may be big in miles.
It's kinda short on people.
So when a man gets fired the way I was fired the story gets around.
Well, I'm...
I'm sorry.
- No, I like to make music.
- And it keeps you near the railroad.
If someone needs information about a payroll, you can sell it.
You know it's a funny thing.
I don't like you either.
- Is that why you sent for me?
- No.
And keep out of this.
Have it your way.
But I don't trust him now any more than I did when I sent him after the Utica Kid.
I sent you after a thief and you gave him a horse to get away on.
- I told you to keep shut.
- Let him talk.
I'm not wearing a gun.
I'll be honest with you.
He'd talk the same if I was.
- It's been nice seeing you.
- (Woman) Grant.
I'm sure Jeff didn't mean to be rude.
Sometimes he has a blunt way of putting things.
Unfortunately, Ben isn't much better.
It's not unfortunate.
It just gets things said in a hurry.
Too much of a hurry.
They forgot to ask you if you'd work for the railroad again.
Would you?
Yes, I would.
Not to give you a short answer.
- It's the answer I wanted.
- Sit down, Grant.
Do you remember Whitey Harbin?
Used to work down in Arizona and New Mexico.
- Yeah.
- Well, he's moved into Colorado.
I thought he favoured stage lines and banks.
So did we.
But he's learned about railroad payrolls
- and he's grabbed three in a row.
- Where do I fit in?
They're making up a supply train in the yard.
I want you to ride it.
- With $10,000 in your pocket.
- Why me?
Quite frankly, because no one would suspect you of carrying a payroll.
I sure don't look like $10,000, do I?
Are you building a bridge you don't need?
The money's here.
Why not bring the men in on Saturday and pay them off in town?
And lose half the crew?
Turn them loose in a mining town, they'll go up the hills looking for gold.
It won't work.
And we have to finish this section before snow comes.
That's a pretty big gamble on a man who gave his horse to a thief!
Yes.
You might as well know the deck's stacked against you.
A boxcar will be hooked to the train.
I'll be one of the men in it.
- When did this happen?
- Last week.
- Renner, did you know?
- Yes.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I told him not to.
- Why?
- Everything we plan gets back to Whitey.
- You think I'd tell him?
- You might trust the wrong people.
- If he takes the job, I'm sure of it.
- And if I don't take it?
Then Jeff will be sitting in Ben's chair.
Oh, I wouldn't like that.
Uh-uh.
So I'll take the job on one condition.
If I make the delivery I get his job.
You made a deal.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
It's getting cold up in the hills.
This coat has always been too long for me.
Thanks.
Well.
I thought you didn't like him.
He said that.
I said I didn't trust him.
And I still don't.
(Verna) Grant.
Are you surprised Ben sent for you?
I was until I talked to him.
He seems to have changed.
You're right.
He doesn't belong in a private car with clerks, figures and pressure from the office.
He belongs at the end of track, running a gang and building a railroad.
- He's a working stiff like you.
- Yes, but he can dream a little too.
Colorado wouldn't have a railroad if he hadn't sold them on the idea.
For his sake, I wish he hadn't.
He was happy at end of track but they kicked him upstairs and sent us to Chicago.
- And now he needs a little help.
- That's why he sent for you.
Oh, I may have had something to do with it.
Why?
There was a time when you were interested in me.
I was more than interested in you.
I wanted to marry you.
Times when I'm sorry you didn't.
Aren't you?
No.
A man likes to know his woman will back him when he's down and you didn't.
Ben called me a thief and you went right along with him.
It's as simple as that.
Grant.
For old times' sake.
For old times' sake?
Just that and nothing more?
Perhaps just a little more.
We want to be sure that payroll goes through, don't we?
I don't know.
Maybe Jeff is right.
His type seldom changes.
And if we've made a mistake, it's the finish of everything.
Then why not cut this car into the supply train?
If we're all playing showdown, I'd like to see the cards when they fall.
- Thank you.
I hope you have a nice trip.
- Thank you.
(Train whistle)
- Ma'am, is that all?
- Mm-hm.
- Here's your lunch.
You've earned it.
- Thanks.
- Mister, are you going to end of track?
- Yes.
Could you stake me to a ticket?
I can ride half fare if I'm with an adult.
- And you're an adult.
- Well, sometimes I wonder.
All right.
You can come along.
We'll ride with the other fellas with no money.
- On the flatcar?
- Go on.
Climb aboard.
Plenty of fresh air.
Do you good, make you grow.
(Clunking)
(Train whistle)
Are you sure he didn't come while I was away?
Ain't nobody been here but the man riding the sorrel.
- What colour horse your man riding?
- How should I know?
It's extremely important that I see him.
They've cut in Mr Kimball's car.
Barley!
A man told you to put his horse up...
Don't start that too.
That there sorrel is the only horse what come in.
That there sorrel is the horse I want.
He belongs to my friend Grant McLaine.
McLaine?
That's who it is.
I knew him as a troubleshooter in Santa Fe before he went bad.
- He didn't go bad.
- What'll you do with his horse?
- Ride him!
I'll change, you saddle him.
- All right.
(Train chugging)
(Train whistle)
Hey, Pilgrim!
Come here!
Don't go getting your liver all upset.
- Once you miss 'em, they stay missed.
- It's none of your business.
- Could be.
You wanting to get on that car?
- If I am?
- I can take you to where it's going.
- On one of these?
They'll get you to end of track before the train does.
- That's ridiculous.
- $100 aging yours I'm right.
- You've got a bet.
- And you got stuck.
Here.
I'll let you ride Flap Ears.
- You can smoke inside, mister.
- I can smoke where I want.
You can burn too if it pleases you but it'll still cost you four bits.
- For what?
- Travelling first-class.
Otherwise ride the flats.
(Discordant notes)
- You play that?
- Yeah, I play it.
- When?
- When?
Whenever somebody throws a dime in my hat.
- I ain't got a dime.
- This one's on me.
(?
Folk tune)
- Been up here before?
- Part way.
- What takes you to end of track?
- A job.
Figured I'd get one at Junction City.
They told me the foremen do the hiring.
You're a little small for swinging a sledge.
- I can carry water.
- Yeah, you can carry water.
- Very important job.
- (Man) Hey!
- What are you doing here?
- He's with me, Pick.
- Where did you get him?
- Somebody threw him away.
Don't you throw him away.
He'll get lost in the mountains.
Who tells the men who build railroads how to get through the mountains?
- The river.
- Huh?
They just follow the river.
- Who told you that?
- I guess my dad was the first.
He had a little song about it.
?
Follow the river
?
The river knows the way
?
Hearts can go astray
?
It happens every day
?
Follow the river
?
Wherever you may be
?
Follow the river back to me?
Wouldn't you wanna be knowing about Concho?
- Who's Concho?
- The man you roped.
Do you wanna know?
Not unless you wanna tell me.
I ought to tell you.
He's fast with a gun.
Only know two men who are faster.
Which two men would they be?
Whitey Harbin for one.
I run away from Whitey.
That's why Concho was after me.
You're one of Whitey's men?
No.
I was in Montrose.
Whitey and his bunch were robbing a bank.
I was just in the road watching.
Whitey was all for killing me but the other fellow wouldn't let him.
He swung me up into the saddle and said,
"You ain't killing a kid.
Not while I ride with you."
- Whitey, he backed down.
- Cos the fella's faster with a gun?
Like lightning.
This other fella, does he have a name?
He's got a name.
The Utica Kid.
I'd have stayed with the bunch if he was boss.
- But he's not?
- Not yet.
Always he's shoving pins into Whitey, laughing at him, driving him crazy.
Even crazier than he is!
Someday Whitey will crack and he'll lose.
(Train whistle)
Is this the fresh air you were talking about?
How come them fellas can ride inside?
Well, it's the old story of good and evil.
If you spend all your money on whiskey, you have none left for a ticket.
Don't drink.
Then you'd have six bits when you need it.
That's very true.
Tell you what, maybe I have six bits.
Yeah.
What do you say we go in and spend it?
Come on.
Guess I wasn't tough enough to follow the river that way.
Sometimes it isn't easy travelling upstream.
- That will be a dollar.
- That'll be six bits.
I'm the adult.
Here.
Hold on to that.
- Don't worry about Concho.
- You would if...
Oh, no, come on.
Sit down.
We can both worry together if you want to tell me about it.
- It's nothing.
- And if it was, you'd rather not say.
All right.
I broke with Whitey.
Doesn't mean I have to talk.
No, you don't have to talk.
I even broke with the Utica Kid.
- Hi, Utica.
- Put him away, Howdy.
Sure.
Come on.
It's a pretty good rig.
Too good for the guy that owned it.
Remember that draw you taught me?
It worked.
He went down with his gun in the leather.
- And now you're an "in case" man.
- In case?
Yeah.
In case you miss six times with one, you draw the other.
- If you have time.
- I'll have time.
Call it.
Draw!
You better learn to draw that one before you fool around with the other.
(Clanking)
(Horse whinnies)
About three inches high, Whitey.
You better take another look at that skull.
Next time it could be yours.
Don't soft-foot up behind me!
It makes me nervous!
So I notice.
What else did you notice?
Did you see Concho?
- Did you see him?
- He wasn't on the trail.
Did I ask you where he wasn't?
I asked you did you see him?
- I would've said so.
- Not straight out you wouldn't.
Because you're a funny man.
You've always gotta be laughing inside.
Well, go ahead, laugh.
But get this, Kid.
I'm a better gun than you.
Or would you like to try?
It's an interesting thought, but I'm afraid of you, Whitey.
(Laughs) You ain't afraid of me.
And in your feet, where your brains are, you think maybe you're just a bit faster.
And you know something?
(Laughs) It could be.
Before you break up completely, you mind putting a name on this?
It's just a little old wedge.
But when you put it through the latch of a boxcar, you can't open the door from the inside.
Now, you ask me, who would want to open the door of a boxcar from the inside?
- Jeff Kurth and a dozen gunmen.
- How would you know?
I was sleeping up there when Concho told you.
You better learn how to snore!
You wouldn't know how to shoot a man in the back.
I'll learn.
What'll it be, gents?
We got Old Grandpa, Old Grandma, Old Uncle Tom.
- And Old Empty.
- You ain't funny, Latigo.
Who could be funny, sweating it out in here?
Get away, boy.
You're too young for whiskey even if we had plenty.
Don't get fancy.
You ain't talking to Joey.
Speaking of Joey, you didn't happen to spot him along the trail, did you?
I'll take a shot of that Old Flannelmouth.
- Did you see him?
- No.
Did he leave any sign?
A little.
He was headed toward Junction City.
But you didn't follow him?
Joey always was a nuisance.
I was for dropping him in the river.
- Why didn't you?
- And get my brains shot out?
You've got to find a better reason to kill me.
Suppose Concho didn't catch up with Joey in town and suppose the kid talked?
- He won't talk.
- Maybe not, but Concho ain't back.
Unless he gets back, we won't know where they're carrying the money.
That's right.
Maybe it'd be smart to let this one go through.
Why?
We've grabbed three in a row.
Let's give them a breather.
That makes sense.
I go along with Utica.
You and me both.
We ought to let this one go through.
It ain't going through!
Why not?
You're the one who taught me about payrolls and now I like them.
- So do I.
- I'll buy that.
A man can get saddle-sore looking for a bank to take.
- I'm with Whitey.
- Me too.
What about you, Torgenson?
I got no complaints.
You call it, I'll play it.
Looks like you've been outvoted.
Or do you want a recount?
- Right now, I'd rather have a drink.
- Suit yourself.
If I can't buy a fight, I'll buy a drink.
Fill 'em up.
Sorry, the bar is closed.
On account of we're fresh out of whiskey.
Either get this floor fixed or get a new bartender.
When do we make the hit?
Any time you're ready.
She was halfway up the grade when I left.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you ask me?
Funny man!
Mount up!
Settle down.
It's only another job.
But if you was boss, we wouldn't do it.
If I was boss we wouldn't do it.
You ain't boss!
?
So I bought myself a shovel and I bought myself a pick
?
And I laid a little track along the bullfrog crick
?
Then I built a locomotive out of 20 empty cans
?
And I tooted on the whistle and the darned thing ran
?
Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
?
You can't get far without a railroad
?
Something's gotta take you there and gotta bring you back
?
You can't go any distance in a buggy or a hack?
(Train whistle)
Throw some ropes around them timbers.
We'll pull it down.
Torgenson!
- OK, John.
- Hurry it up, Jubilee!
- Boy, they're pushing her fast today.
- Yeah!
Maybe they heard I needed a quick ten thousand.
- That water tower your idea?
- What's wrong with it?
Any self-respecting Injun could walk away with it.
Funny man!
He knows everything about everything.
Let's get down and lock the barn door.
- (Neighing)
- We've stopped!
Whitey's making his hit!
- McLaine sold us out!
- No, Ben.
They didn't learn it from Grant.
Leary!
- A hold-up!
- They did it again!
Stop your moaning and hold on to your hat!
They won't stop old Tommy Shannon with a tank full of water.
That's no way to treat railroad property, Mr Shannon.
Take your hand off the throttle and reach for the brake!
All right.
Sit down and behave!
Come over here.
Open the safe!
- Ha!
- Move in!
Same as last time!
- We thought you were lost or drunk.
- There ain't nothing in there.
(Man) Jubilee!
How are you making out?
Try to talk your way out of this!
- I'm sorry I missed out with Renner.
- Never mind.
Where's the money?
- It's not in the safe.
- Then where is it?
It could be going to Junction City with Jeff's men.
That's not true.
Renner told us Jeff wouldn't carry the payroll!
That's a help.
Least we know who didn't carry it.
Funny man!
When you get through laughing, see what's in that red car.
Sure.
Glad to.
As soon as I pick up my horse.
He's worth more than anything I'm gonna find on this train.
Get those pilgrims out.
Maybe one of them is carrying it.
Hit the other cars!
See if you can find it.
Outside!
All of you!
Is this what you wanted to tell me?
Have a look inside, Latigo!
If that's McLaine...
No, Ben.
Put it away.
You may as well be comfortable.
- Be my guest.
- Gladly.
Do you mind if I ask the name of my host?
No, I don't mind.
Would the payroll be in there?
No.
Why not take a look, just to be sure?
Boy, is this stuff mellow.
Bottled in bond too.
- I forgot.
Ladies is always first.
- Thank you, no.
See for yourself.
Hello, Joey.
What are you doing here?
Getting robbed!
Don't bother.
None of them's got more than two dollars.
Whitey!
There ain't no payroll in there.
How come you missed out?
- I had a little trouble.
- Now, ain't that too bad?
- Maybe I ought to give you a little more.
- Whitey!
Kimball's back there with his wife.
(Laughs)
You just got lucky!
Put them back in the car!
(Concho) Get aboard!
Go on.
Good little boys don't run away.
This time you'll learn!
- Where's the payroll?
- The man says he doesn't know.
I can help him remember.
Take her outside.
Take her outside yourself.
I'm afraid of women.
They scream and scratch, and sometimes step on your toes.
Don't say no to me.
Not when I got a gun in my hand.
I won't.
Unless I'm holding one too.
- Outside.
- If you want the payroll...
You'll have to wait for the next work train.
We decided not to send it through on this one.
Oh?
I don't mind waiting.
I'll be at Pay Load.
You can bring it to me.
Then I'll take 12 hours' start, you get your wife back.
See what happens when you don't carry your brains in your feet?
I ought to make you walk.
Jubilee, lead them out.
Step up with Latigo.
(Concho) What about Joey?
You gonna leave him here?
He'll ride with me.
Or would you like to?
Settle down.
We're getting $10,000 for the lady, remember?
Which one do I ride with?
(Laughs) Which one do you think?
Take her to the end of track, Mr Shannon!
(Train whistle)
Here's a stirrup.
Give you a lift?
I'll take that box.
Don't crowd the cantle.
You'll ride easier.
Whoa, mules!
Must have got tired of making the climb and started home.
- Come on, boy!
- Just a minute.
There's a mining town near here.
It used to be called Pay Load.
It's still called Pay Load but nobody lives there.
- It's over beyond that far hill.
- Which hill?
- You see the first hill?
- Yes.
See the second one?
There's a third hill.
Pay Load's behind that.
- How much do you want for this mule?
- $50.
Flap Ears, when you unload this piker, you come on home to mother.
- Get outta there!
- Gah!
Welshing on a bet!
Never could understand them railroad people.
Come on!
Come on!
(Train whistle)
- Mr Kimball.
- Come over to the telegraph shack.
- Before you pass.
Did you bring the payroll?
- Not now!
- Did you bring it?
- I didn't.
- Now what?
- The end of the railroad.
- Shut up, Feeney.
- Let go of me or I'll push this down your throat!
Who wants your man?
I don't want none of 'em!
They're all broke!
- See you in Denver.
- I'm off to Denver too.
- So am I!
- Nobody goes without orders from Kimball!
- I'm leaving.
- You are not.
You'll take no joyride in this town with them painted hussies.
We've waited this long.
Another night won't hurt us.
But if the money's not here in the morning, out we go!
Get back to work!
(Clicking)
We're beat, Mr Kimball.
Without the pay, the gang will go to Junction City.
- I know.
- Any word from Jeff?
He's in Junction City.
Says the car held to the grade all the way.
He and his men will be after Whitey in...
They will not!
Tell him to stay right where he is until further orders.
Yes, sir.
Wonder if he thinks that's private property.
If he tries to divide that like he cuts up the loot, there's gonna be shooting.
- Your laundry?
- Sandwiches.
Do you want one?
No.
Where did you get them?
Junction City.
A girl in a restaurant gave them to me.
- Was she pretty?
- Mm-hm.
- Think you could get me a date?
- She's not that kind of a girl.
Any of you boys win enough to buy a drink?
- You ain't got a drink.
- I got a drink.
(Clamouring)
- I thought you was fresh out.
- I was till we made the hit.
While you looked for the payroll that wasn't there, I had important business.
(Man) Come on, fill her up.
Latigo ought to be running this bunch.
We might not eat, but we'd sure drink.
Ha ha!
You're a funny man.
Why don't you laugh?
- Am I supposed to?
- Not if you're smart.
- I think you're smart.
- And what else do you think?
That you made a mistake.
She'll only bring you trouble and guns.
Since when is $10,000 trouble?
That's exactly what you're worth.
You're very flattering.
But I'm inclined to agree with you.
Don't make a habit of it.
Latigo, I want a drink!
And you've got a few habits I don't like either.
Settle down.
Do you see what she's up to?
I can see you.
And what I see I don't like too good.
- I guess you could use one.
- Thank you, no.
- It's the best.
I got it off your own bar.
- You drink it.
Sorry, lady, I don't drink.
I'm studying to be a bartender.
- Don't you drink?
- Not alone.
Suppose I join you?
- Do you mind?
- And if I do?
Don't push it.
For a little while you're gonna need me and I'm gonna need you.
I watched you walk.
I could swear we've met before.
Could you?
Funny little things you do.
Like when you smile.
Strange.
I seem to recognise all your mannerisms, if you know what that means.
- I know what that means.
- Do you?
I'm supposed to fight Whitey over you.
With a little luck we'd kill each other.
- It's an interesting thought.
- What's interesting?
- She is.
- You're so right. (Laughs)
I may not send you back.
Not until you've helped me spend the ten thousand.
- You mind if we join the party?
- Yes!
You shouldn't, cos if you guess wrong you ain't gonna hang alone.
You like another drink?
- Thanks, I still have this one.
- Drink them both.
Anybody want to start the dance?
With only one girl?
Get back to the bar where you belong.
Let's all get back to the bar, where we belong.
- You almost got your wish.
- One of them.
- The other?
- To know your name.
His name?
He's the Utica Kid.
I don't like it either.
My family used to call me Lee.
Why don't you?
You're supposed to be outside.
(Horse whinnies)
Come out with your hands up.
- What are you doing here?
- I want to see the Utica Kid.
- Who are you?
- A friend of his.
Funny thing, he never told me about no girlfriend.
(Charlie) Is there any reason why he should?
- What's your name?
- Charlie Drew.
And you can put that gun away.
Or do I look dangerous?
Not exactly.
(Charlie yelps)
Give me that rope.
- When'd you get here?
- Just before they rode in.
Utica pulled the job off right on schedule.
I suppose you've known it was going to happen for quite some time.
No, I haven't.
Utica doesn't talk to me about jobs.
Not this kind.
- Did he ever have any other kind?
- He will have.
Soon.
Then why don't you hold out?
Why don't you keep away till he stops being a thief?
I told him that's what I'd do.
He just looked at me and smiled.
He said, "I wonder if you can."
Tonight he has his answer.
You're here.
Yes, but only to tell him that you're...
Only to tell him I'm in town and might come looking for him.
I want to keep him alive.
I want to keep you alive.
- You know what he can do with a gun.
- I know.
- Well, then, why?
- Because of a little thing called self-respect.
Maybe you wouldn't understand anything about that.
For five years I've played that thing for nickels and dimes thrown into a hat.
For five years the Utica Kid has been laughing.
I may have been wrong, Charlie, but I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.
Grant...
When you see him will you tell him that I'm here?
Leave it alone!
So all she'll bring is trouble and guns, huh?
Did you bring the money with you?
No.
- How soon do we get it?
- I wouldn't know about that.
You should!
$10,000 is a lot of money.
And that's what he wants for me.
Well, I'd say he was selling out cheap.
Never mind what you'd say.
What did Kimball say?
If you don't know about the money, why did he send you?
He didn't send me.
I came on my own.
Why?
- Ask him.
- Well?
I wouldn't know.
Then again, maybe I would.
You were right the first time.
I can walk quiet at night and I'm a pretty good gun.
I'd like to join up with you.
You see, when a man gets fired off the railroad, he has a little trouble finding a job.
And when he can't find a job, he gets hungry.
I've been hungry for the last five years.
Haven't I?
- (Whitey) How would he know?
- I'm his brother.
- His brother?
- His younger brother.
Five years ago he was a troubleshooter for Kimball.
I lifted the feed herd and he came after me.
Then gave you a horse to get away.
But not until I'd heard all about good and evil.
I didn't buy what he had to sell then.
I'm not buying it now.
